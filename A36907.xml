            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THose Two well known and useful Books bearing my Father <hi>Dunton</hi>'s Name, (Entituled, <hi>The House of Weeping,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Dying Pastors last Legacy,</hi> &amp;c.) sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wonderfully beyond all expectation, have encouraged me now a <hi>Third time</hi> to reoblige the World (but in a more especial manner my beloved <hi>Country-men,</hi> and you my Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intimate Friends,) by publishing another Treatise of his which you here see is entituled,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sighs and Groans of a Dying man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi> which said Treatise was fairly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out for the Press <hi>(as many of you very well know)</hi> with my Fathers own hands just before his Death; and if this pleases as well as the two former pieces (as doubtless it will, for it doth together with some of the other <hi>Fifty</hi> Treatises accompanying of it, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Whole Duty of a <hi>Sincere Christian</hi>) I intend out of hand to expose some more of his Works to <hi>publick View:</hi> But many of them being written in <hi>Short-hand</hi> (and no body being able to read his Characters but my self) they'l take me up some <hi>little time</hi> to Transcribe them <hi>fair</hi> for the <hi>Press.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> if any wonder that this <hi>present Treatise</hi> comes into this <hi>wide World</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some <hi>Great or Noble Man</hi> for its <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52888:3"/> let such know that such Dedications begin now adaies to grow out of Fashion, his Policy was commended by many (and proved profitable to himself) who instead of Select <hi>Grandees</hi> for <hi>his Godfathers</hi> made all the Congregation <hi>Witnesses</hi> to his Child: so would I, if I could, invite you <hi>all together</hi> that are my Friends (and the whole <hi>English</hi> Nation besides) to this useful Book request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, and all therein to Patronize such parts and passages thereof as please you best, so hoping that by several Persons <hi>of all Ranks and Degrees</hi> the whole will be protected.</p>
            <p>But the Truth of it is <hi>to all</hi> you mentioned on the first Page chiefly, and of right belongs the <hi>Dedication</hi> of this Book; for surely those many and great Favours and daily continued Courtesies, which I have received from you may well challenge and command a <hi>double Expression</hi> of thanks and acknowledgement from me. And I knew not wherein I might more publickly, and better testifie my <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to you than by presenting you with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might abide by you (and be your daily Companion both abroad and at home) as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of that solemn respect and service which I owe to you all.</p>
            <p>I have read of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> and many others, but the <hi>Past, Present or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:52888:4"/> Age</hi> have not, nor never will produce such a <hi>Stupendious</hi> Example of Friendship and entire respect as yours hath been to me, which tho I cannot fully requite (should I live to the years of <hi>Methusalem</hi>) yet I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease (whilst I have breath to fetch) kindly to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moreover,</hi> I very well knew any thing that had <hi>my Dear deceased Fathers</hi> name <hi>stampt</hi> upon it, would be very gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And further consider, that tho for the present our loss may seem great, yet if any Memory on earth goes with us to Heaven, he now being nearer the Fountain of Love, <hi>loves</hi> us more than ever, and now is better able to express it in <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>dearer</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
<pb facs="tcp:52888:4"/> but if all remembrance of Friends and Kindred dye with us, yet still he <hi>loves</hi> us more then he could ever <hi>possibly</hi> upon Earth, tho in another relation the thoughts of which should stop the <hi>current</hi> of those Tears wherewith our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>eyes</hi> are so <hi>big</hi> and <hi>full.</hi>

               <p>Here further you may see (throughout the whole Allegory) how that this present transitory Life is called a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> a <hi>Travel</hi> and a way, because it continually plieth to an end; For as they which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in <hi>Coaches,</hi> or sail in <hi>Ships,</hi> do finish their <hi>Voyage,</hi> tho they sit still and sleep, <hi>even</hi> so every one of us, <hi>albeit</hi> we be still busied about other matters, and perceive not how the <hi>course</hi> of our <hi>Life passeth away,</hi> being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Rest,</hi> sometimes <hi>at work,</hi> sometimes <hi>Idle,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>sports</hi> and <hi>recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> yet our life alwaies <hi>wasteth,</hi> and we in posting speed with <hi>winged hast</hi> towards our last end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And loe! as our way-faring Pilgrim (describ'd in this Book) travelleth apace and leaveth many things behind him; even so it fares with us: For the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Pilgrim in his way sometimes seeth
<pb facs="tcp:52888:5"/> stately Towers and sumptuous Buildings, he beholdeth them a while, he admires them, and so passeth from them; afterwards he seeth Green Fields, fine Meadows, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Pastures, and goodly Vine-yards, upon these also (with pleasing delight) he looketh a while, he wondreth at the sight, and so passeth by, then he meeteth with fruitful Orchards, green Forests, long Chaces, delightful Plains, lovely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, pleasant Fields, huge Thickets and spreading Trees full of all manner of flying Fowls and singing Birds, sweet Rivers with silver Streams, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himself as before. At the length, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cometh at his Journeys end, he meeteth with lonesome Desarts, hard Waies, rough, and unpleasant, foul, and over-grown with Bryars and Thornes, here also he is enforced for a time to stay: He laboureth, sweateth, and is grieved; but when he hath gone awhile, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh these difficulties and getting at last a clear and distinct Prospect of the end of his Journey he remembreth no more his former Griefs and Danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Just thus it is</hi> with us who like <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> are travelling and posting <hi>apace towards</hi> our <hi>long homes,</hi> one while we meet with pleasant and delightful things,
<pb facs="tcp:52888:6"/> another while we meet with affrighting, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and grievous crosses, but they all in a <hi>moment pass away</hi> and are gone and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish even like <hi>Mist</hi> before the <hi>early Sun.</hi> And look as a pleasant <hi>Landskip</hi> which at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance seemeth to the eye <hi>rough, and uneven,</hi> (by reason that here is <hi>shadow'd</hi> a Hill, or Dale, there a Plain, and green row of Trees, yonder a Church, a Town, a City, a Village with Rivers <hi>(full of Swans)</hi> running by it; Then here again a <hi>poor Cottage,</hi> a shady Grove, a delightful Meadow, <hi>Birds flying,</hi> a sturdy Castle, and behind that some <hi>demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht Fabrick) yet</hi> if you come close to it all appears both smooth and even.</p>
               <p>Just thus it is with every <hi>Christian Pilgrim,</hi> who when he first <hi>sets out</hi> for Heaven, or whilst he is on his <hi>Travels</hi> thither, all things seem to appear to him <hi>rough, harsh and unpleasant,</hi> but when he comes close and near to his <hi>Journeys end,</hi> and just within prospect of Happiness, all things appear to him <hi>smooth, plain and delightful.</hi>

                  <l>This <hi>weary Pilgrim</hi> oft did <hi>ask</hi> to know</l>

               <p>But then again this <hi>Heavenly Guide</hi> shews plainly to every <hi>Christian Pilgrim</hi> what strange discouragements he must expect to meet with on the road to the <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paradice,</hi> and how that his way thither is not all along strew'd with fragrant Flowers, with pleasant <hi>Fountains,</hi> and <hi>green and shady Walks</hi> (as many weak <hi>Pilgrims</hi> foolishly imagine when they first set out on their <hi>Journey for Heaven</hi>) for turmoiling fears and perplexities will attend every resolved <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> almost in every state and place he passes through.</p>

               <p>Wherein you have in most <hi>winning</hi> and <hi>affectionate Language; First,</hi> The <hi>whole Art</hi> of <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well,</hi> impartially represented to your view. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> wherefore <hi>Death</hi> is a <hi>serious thing;</hi> and how can this be rationally doubted? (tho it is by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical Spirits</hi> of this Age) for when a man dies, he takes his <hi>solemn leave</hi> of one <hi>World</hi> and goes into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (where he <hi>never was yet</hi>) to receive his <hi>last</hi> and <hi>final Doom,</hi> either to be <hi>Saved</hi> or <hi>Damned</hi> to all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Herein is shown how we ought to live in a continual
<pb facs="tcp:52888:8"/> preparation for <hi>Death</hi> all our life long, with an account of the infinite hazard of a <hi>Death-bed Repentance,</hi> or <hi>ventring</hi> Eternity upon our <hi>last breath.

Eighthly,</hi> You have an Act of holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of amendment of life in case of Recovery. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> You have in <hi>this Passing-Bell,</hi> the Reasons why the English People shut the eyes and mouth of their dead Friends as soon as ever they are departed. <hi>Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> You have the reasons why dead bodies are often kissed. <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> The reason why dead Bodies are often wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> You have the reasons why the dead are often perfumed and Embalmed, <hi>&amp;c. Thirteenthly,</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> why the dead are usually cloathed with white Linnen (or other sutable dresses) before they are put into their Coffins. <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> You have the Reasons of the pomp and Ceremony wherewith the English carry thier Dead to the Grave. In the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> place, you have in this Treatise called, <hi>The Passing-Bell,</hi> a preparation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Contingencies</hi> and treatings of our deceased Friends in order to their Burial. <hi>Sixteenthly,</hi> The manner how the English Bury their Dead. <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly,</hi> The exact Method that ought to be observed <hi>in Funeral Processions</hi> for most Ranks and Degrees of men. In the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> place, in this <hi>Passing-Bell,</hi> you will see how Death is borne with us, goes along with us hand in hand through all the Stages of our Life;
<pb facs="tcp:52888:9"/> how Infancy dyes into Child-hood, Childhood into Youth, Youth into Manhood, and so on till Old Age comes where we part <hi>fairly</hi> at our <hi>Journeys end,</hi> unless some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, a Sword, a Bullet, or a Disease meet us and makes us break company at <hi>Half way,</hi> as it very often doth, for Death throws at all with an <hi>Impartial hand,</hi> and even scorns to spare any; he doth not crouch to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> and humbly beg their leave to kill them; he Kills not <hi>Kings</hi> upon his <hi>bended knee,</hi> nor doth his darts use any more Ceremony to a Prince upon the Throne, than to the poorest Beggar on the Dunghill, or lowest Vassal that crawls on the ground, both die and turn to dust alike. Further is shown how the <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> costly and embroidered <hi>Sear-cloth stinks,</hi> as well as the rags and half sheet of the Beggar.</p>
               <p>Nay how, even Kings themselves corrupt under their grandy Tombs and glorious Arches as well as poor <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who goes to bed in silence, naked, and without a covering. Then in the <hi>Nineteenth place,</hi> you have an account how that 'tis neither <hi>Riches, Stately Friends, worldly Pomp,</hi> nor <hi>Honours</hi> too can Shield us from the stroke of <hi>Death:</hi> For take <hi>Man,</hi> extend him as big as you please, let your <hi>fancy</hi> stretch him till she <hi>crack her self; Cloath</hi> him with purple, then beset that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Jewels as thick and large until he look not like a <hi>Man</hi> but a <hi>Firmament:</hi> Let <hi>Crowns and Miters</hi> shoot down like Stars that fall; set him in the <hi>midst of perpetual Victories;</hi> let <hi>vanquish'd Towns, Cities, Kingdoms, Empires, Lordships and Mannors be his Footstool,</hi> and let <hi>Conquer'd</hi> Princes and Governours be the <hi>Cushions</hi> to it. And let one stand and proclaim before him all what ever proud <hi>Titles</hi> or <hi>Honours</hi> (which are but a <hi>blaze</hi> blown by the <hi>breath</hi> of a mortal <hi>Man</hi>) or <hi>Ambition</hi> hath aspir'd to, or <hi>Fancy</hi> can dictate, call him <hi>King of Kings, the Husband to Fortune and Cousin to the Gods, yet</hi> af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But to proceed (in the 21st place) here is further shown that the road of Death is as common as 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, <hi>Infants as well as men daily can direct us in it,</hi> witness every <hi>Church-yard,</hi> where are to be seen <hi>Graves of all sizes:</hi> but the business is not so much to dye, as to dye well, which this <hi>Passing-bell</hi> shews you is only obtained by living well.</p>
               <p>It is indeed often uncomfortable to nature (especially when a man stands upon the <hi>brink of an endless Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>) to behold the sad <hi>stages</hi> of Corruption and Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dust and Darkness,</hi> and of a <hi>lasting silence.</hi> But the only way to <hi>overcome</hi> death is to be resolved to meet it, and to be ready with a <hi>kind and a hearty welcome</hi> to entertain it, or rather to bid it as it were defiance in the open field by a <hi>truly vertuous and godly life.</hi> And <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> under this Head is shown, that when we come to dye we shall see (whatever we may now think) that <hi>Mines</hi> of Gold, <hi>Rocks</hi> of Diamonds, <hi>Lordships</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters, Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> are not worth one <hi>Drachm of Grace, one Smile from Heaven, one Embrace of a Saviour,</hi> and how they are

               <p>As to the several <hi>Emblems</hi> belonging to this Book, I shall here in this <hi>Epistle</hi> take little notice of <hi>them,</hi> they being fully explained in their <hi>respective places</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book, but only speak <hi>something</hi> of those that relate to the <hi>sick-mans Passing-Bell:</hi> wherein you have described to the Eye in Figures <hi>(after a most lively manner) 1.</hi> How the Minister (being sent for)
<pb facs="tcp:52888:13"/> comes to visit the Dying-man, with the manner of the <hi>Sick-mans</hi> carriage when he came there. 2ly. (means proving ineffectual) how the <hi>Sick-man</hi> gives up the Ghost, and how forthwith upon this the <hi>Passing-Bell</hi> is Rung out by the <hi>diligent Clark,</hi> to tell the whole <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Neighbourhood, Town, and Parish,</hi> That the Poor-man is dead that lately lay sick <hi>(being gone the way of all flesh)</hi> and that they should prepare speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow after, none of them all knowing whose turn may be next.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Then what is Life! But the flourishing array</l>
                  <l>Of the Green Summers Meadow, which to day,</l>

                  </gap>pon the <hi>Sick-man,</hi> (he being departed this mortal life)
<q>
                     <l>Methinks I see Grim Death, that aged Sire,</l>
                     <l>Fly to next Town, with Wings that ne're will tire.</l>
                     <l>Upon his bare Head an <hi>Hour-Glass</hi> he wears,</l>

                     <l>Methinks I hear the doleful Passing-Bell,</l>
                     <l>Setting an onset to the Dead mans Knell.</l>
                     <l>(This moody Musick of Impartial Death,</l>
                     <l>Who dances after dances out of breath.)</l>
                     <l>Methinks I see his dearest Friends lament,</l>
                     <l>With Sighs, and Tears, and woful dryriment:</l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52888:14"/>
                     <l>His tender Wife and Sisters standing by,</l>
                     <l>Dewing the Death-bed whereon he doth ly;</l>
                     <l>Methinks I hear a voice in secret say,</l>
                     <l>Their Glass is run too, they must dye next day.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But then in the next place is represented (to the Life) how the man as soon as he is dead, is stript and laid out all along on the Bed, and how from thence, in about three days time (his Face being pale and wan, his Cheeks fallen, and his Eyes being sunk into his Head, and he becoming a frightful Spectacle to his very Friends) he is haled in his Winding Sheet to his Coffin with the manner how the weeping Mother, sorrowful Children and sighing Friends spend over him <hi>many, many</hi> a bitter tear, whilst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably all this while the greedy Nurses are fighting and scufling for his very Shirt and Cloathes, and the <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sons</hi> too <hi>Boxing</hi> and <hi>Duelling</hi> of it valiantly for the <hi>Mony and Goods</hi> that he hath left behind.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place is shown how the <hi>Dead-mans nearest</hi> and <hi>dearest Friends</hi> are invited to his Funeral with the manner how upon his <hi>Relations shoulders</hi> (after the <hi>usual Complement</hi> of a sprig of <hi>Rosemary,</hi> a Glass of <hi>Burnt Claret,</hi> paper of <hi>Biskets, Gold Ring,</hi> or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Plumb-Cake</hi> is over) he is carryed to the <hi>Church,</hi> where often for the sake and instruction of the living, a <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> or <hi>Oration</hi> is made, (and very likely if he was rich, or left a good Fee to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Parish) at the latter end of it he is extold to the Skies, as the <hi>Nonesuch</hi> of the <hi>Age, Town</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> wherein he lived, where as large <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miastical Praises</hi> of the Dead, unless their lives were eminent in Goodness, and free from any notable Blot, are much <hi>condemned</hi> by the most judicious and godly Divines, as a thing of very <hi>evil consequence,</hi> because they often prove <hi>Confections of Poyson</hi> to the <hi>Living;</hi> for many, whose lives speak nothing for them, will draw the example into consequence, and be thereby, led int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:52888:14"/> hopes that they may press <hi>a Hackney Funeral Sermon</hi> to carry them to <hi>Heaven</hi> when they <hi>dye;</hi> on the other hand it may be said, that though <hi>common Graves</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no Inscription, yet <hi>Marble Tombs</hi> are not without some <hi>Epitaph: Heroical</hi> and <hi>vertuous Examples</hi> should not go with a Common Pass but with a <hi>Trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the sixth place is represented after what mournful manner the <hi>Dead-mans</hi> Corps or Herse is carryed <hi>(when the Doleful Bell begins to Toll)</hi> to its s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lemn <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> where the Drooping Pomp ends, and where the Mourners and Supporters of his Pall, (and likewise his weeping Friends,) (after committing <hi>Ashes</hi> to <hi>Ashes, Dust</hi> to <hi>Dust</hi> in sure and certain hope (if the man dyed a sincere Christian of his resurrection at the last day to <hi>Eternal Life</hi>) leave his pale Carcass to make a splendid Feast for the Worms to feed on.</p>
               <p>In the seventh place (in these Emblems) is shown how poor <hi>frail man,</hi> from all <hi>Fortunes store</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of his days can reap no more than a <hi>narrow Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin and a scanty Grave,</hi> with the manner how our <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> into the world, and <hi>exit</hi> out of it, seem to meet, and what affinity there is between our Winding Sheet and Swadling Bands.</p>
               <p>In the eighth place, by these Emblems belonging to the <hi>Sick-mans Passing-Bell</hi> is shown, 1st how <hi>fading</hi> man doth but as it were, just arise from <hi>mother Earth</hi> to take <hi>one single</hi> turn upon <hi>the Stage of the World,</hi> with a necessity (by reason of sin) to return again and dye <hi>(2.)</hi> How poorly and meanly clad we must enter into our Coffins, a Winding Sheet, and one poor Shrowd being all we can carry with us, or our Friends will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon us when they take of us their <hi>last Farewell. (3.)</hi> After what dismal and distracted manner some Relations carry it at their Friends Graves with the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Ahone; Ahone;</hi> ringing of Hands, tearing of Hair and sheding of Tears they make there, with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of one that did thus passionately follow her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb facs="tcp:52888:15"/> to the Grave (nay desired to be buried alive with him) that as soon as ever the black attire of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was over, marries another, with whom she lived extream merrily all her days. By which you may see when once we are <hi>dead and gone,</hi> our Friends will think no more of us than we are wont to do of them we now survive. And we know not how soon that very earth which we now so negligently tread upon, may receive us into her cold Embraces,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Veiw then these Emblems, and Revolve this Book,</l>
                  <l>For Deaths mementoes, stand where e're you look.</l>

                  <hi>But I should quite tire your patience, should I run over all those delightful Heads which this</hi> Passing-Bell <hi>treats of, I shall therefore here make a stop — And in the next place proceed to tell you, that there is in this Book, besides what I have already told you of, a</hi> third Course <hi>prepared for you, of no less than fifty several pleasant Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Treatises (rarely if ever handled before) all of them being <hi>greatly useful,</hi> and will afford extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary pleasure and delight in the perusal (as was said in the Title page) if either profit or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty will do it; nay further I must tell you, if depth of Fancy, variety and greatness of Subjects are capable of affording satisfaction to a Reader, you will have throughout this</hi> whole Work, <hi>I now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with, abundantly to satisfie your curiosity. But here again I should be too tedious should I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther write all the particulars wherein this Book doth excel, or give you the names of the</hi> fifty several Treatises <hi>just now spoken of: I shall therefore at present add no more, but my sincere and hearty wishes, that when your worldly Enjoyments, Incomparable Good Humours, and Earthly Splendor, shall be shri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to nothing, or at least into a cold remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
<pb facs="tcp:52888:15"/> that even then the sweet perfume of your truly vertuous Deeds and most generous Actions may remain afterwards more fragrant, fresh and green than the</hi> Flourishing Grass <hi>that in</hi> Chesham <hi>Church-yard shall cover your mournful Graves when your souls are past into Immortality; and that your very names may be as living Examples of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety to after Ages, or rather that they may bury monuments, behold the worlds Funeral, see Time laid in the Dust, and stand up with Eternity:</hi>

               <p>If it were my work in this paper to recount all my <hi>Adventures,</hi> and the several issues of them <hi>(which are enough to fill a large Folio)</hi> the story I believe would not be altogether useless, nor without that charming <hi>pleasure</hi> which such relations are wont to yield to those that read them: But having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved for <hi>divers causes</hi> to begin the main History of my Life, there where I began to enjoy a <hi>taste of Happiness,</hi> I shall reflect no further upon my <hi>Infancy, Youth, Riper Years,</hi> and <hi>Old Age</hi> then only to tell you in what case that blessed hour found me: you must know then after so many tedious Journeys, and as many disappointments, my legs beginning quite to fail me, and to deny me so much as their support, I sat down upon the <hi>green grass,</hi> in a deep Melancholy and such a great heaviness of mind, that I feared I should sink still <hi>lower and lower, and go no further</hi> to <hi>seek a Grave,</hi> my countenance was so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that there were very few marks remaining of the same man I was before, my looks were strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dejected, my eyes grew hollow, my complexion turned as white as a <hi>Clout;</hi> and <hi>in short,</hi> my whole blood was so impoverished of Spirits, that my <hi>flesh</hi> fell to the very bone, and my <hi>Cheeks</hi> in a despair of any other comfort seemed to desire <hi>to meet, and so bid the World farewel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this dismal estate I continued but too many days, and according to the nature of that thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful humour which now had gained the supreme power over me, I mused on divers things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived several new Journeys in my fancy, which yet I saw at the same moment, would only contribute more to my affliction, and nothing at all to the amendment of my condition. But at last, as if I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52888:18"/> had been admonished by some <hi>courteous Angel,</hi> which I fancied then flew by me, and gave me a small touch with his wing, I felt a thought stir in my Soul, remembring me of a place ca led <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which I had totally forgot in all my <hi>Travels,</hi> and never so much as dreamed of directing my course unto. My <hi>Heart,</hi> you may easily think, leapt at this sudden stroke, and my <hi>Pulse</hi> beat at no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rate; for hearing by some means or other in times past, very much discourse of the <hi>beauty and the pleasant Scituation of that City;</hi> of the sweet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> and the many goodly things that were to be seen and enjoyed there above all other places, I was instantly possessed with a strong desire to remove my seat thither, and to seek my fortune (as we commonly speak) <hi>in another World.</hi> And Pondering seriously with my self the little or no contentment which I had taken in my best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here, together with the hopes which flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my soul of bettering my self there; my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent weakness could not hinder me from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with a conceit that I should be able to <hi>Travel</hi> thither, nor depress my desires from going into a kind of passion to be at that place, whither my thoughts did run before me without my leave, and could not be perswaded to stand still for <hi>one moment.</hi>

When we came there, we found that the <hi>Guide</hi> was at home, and that he had not one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his company: so after a very few Civilities passed between us, and some excuses that we made for our boldness in interrupting his meditations, I plainly told him what the real cause of my present address to him was, and of the trouble I was come to give him. I am, said I, a true lover of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and have made a vow (by God's assistance) to take a <hi>Journey</hi> to that blessed place, but about the way thither I am so perplexed, that I account it a great blessing that I have not <hi>lost my wits,</hi> and am not become unable to travel to your House: One cries to me, <hi>Lo here!</hi> another, <hi>lo there!</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>lo yonder</hi> lies the path of Life.

               <p>NOw I appearing in habit <hi>like</hi> a <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> having a very <hi>innocent Countenance,</hi> an humble behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and using such language as signified that it was not curiosity, or a mind to try the skill which he had in <hi>forreign Parts,</hi> but a real desire to <hi>travel</hi> which brought me thither; he therefore returned me this answear, that he was heartily glad to meet with any man that would ask the way to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and that he thought he read in my face so much of the serenity of my mind, and the sincerity of my heart, that he might be confident I came with a real desire to <hi>receive satisfaction</hi> about it. But said he, tho' I must needs confess I can <hi>safely guide</hi> you in the right way to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and am willing to do it; yet I believe I may spare my pains in giving you <hi>directions,</hi> because there is some reason to think you will not be at the pains to follow them: For if you will give any credit to my words, I must let you know that the way to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is both <hi>long</hi> and also full of <hi>many</hi> and <hi>great difficulties;</hi> and that there are many waies which will seem to you to lead <hi>strait</hi> to it, and which many men will <hi>point</hi> you unto, as the <hi>next Road,</hi> which if you should take, will lead you into great danger, and not only carry you a great deal about, but perchance conduct you to the quite contrary place, and end in your utter undoing, I would wish you therefore to consider a while,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52888:23"/> whether it be an advisable thing to undertake such a <hi>Journey,</hi> wherein there are so many hardships and so many cross <hi>paths;</hi> a <hi>Journey</hi> which is so <hi>tedious</hi> also, and wherein I cannot promise you security from <hi>Frights, Thieves, Beatings,</hi> and such ill usages as have made many men possessed with such inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as you seem now to have, quite to lay aside all thoughts of it, and to <hi>sit down contented</hi> at their <hi>own homes;</hi> and after all this, I know not whether you will yield your belief to all that I shall tell you you must encounter with if ever you get to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> For, <hi>First,</hi> you must expect to be mightily hindred in your way thither by <hi>evil Companions</hi> of all Ranks and Degrees. <hi>Secondly,</hi> you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be fiercely set upon (and that almost to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of your Life) by three powerful Enemies (<hi>World, Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi>) which will haunt you constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both in company and in secret, besides seven other Enemies, whose names are <hi>Pride, Coveteousness, Letchery, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Sloth,</hi> under a colour of bearing you <hi>Company</hi> for your Recreation and Delight, will earnestly seek your undoing. <hi>Moreover,</hi> by the treacherous assault of these <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> your <hi>Cinque Ports, Sight, Hearing, Smell, Tast,</hi> and <hi>Touch</hi> will become endangered; and besides all these an hundred Enemies more you must expect to meet with, but time at present will not permit me to tell you who they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After I had, with a great deal of patience,</hi> heard what he said, I was so far from shewing any tokens of disgust at his discourse, that I rather discovered an <hi>inward pleasure</hi> that I had received in his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with me; and after I had rendred him hearty thanks for dealing so impartially with me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeched him that he would not think it fit to spare his pains, which he had already, with no small suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, begun to bestow, but that he would make a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52888:24"/>
                  <hi>poor Soul so happy</hi> as to let it know from that mouth which he perceived would not deceive or misguide it, that difficult, long and dangerous <hi>way</hi> which leads to <hi>Jerusalem. And now</hi> I am not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late how much this devout person (who now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himself to be both my <hi>Friend and Guide</hi>) was over-joyed to hear this <hi>welcom language:</hi> And he now begins to direct me in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Before you begin your Journey (saies he) or set one step in the way you resolve to go, have these few words in your mind, and sometimes upon your Tongue, <hi>I am nought, I have nought, I desire nought,</hi> but only to be with Jesus at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> further (said my Guide) I advise you before you enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so long a <hi>Journey,</hi> to see that your body be in good health, lest you should fall into any such sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the way as might prove dangerous and fatal to you, and for that end I would also wish you to take some <hi>Physick,</hi> the better to prepare your self for Travel, and to disburthen nature of all those ill humours wherewith you may abound, which will at least indispose you and make you lazy, and soon weary if they be not timely discharged and carried away; now the best Counsels I can give you of this kind are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I would have you purge your thoughts of all unworthy thoughts of God, and perswade your self that he is very good and earnestly desires to see you at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then it must be your care, when your mind hath recovered right thoughts of God to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie your intentions</hi> throughly, and to see that they be unspotted in his sight, protest to him a <hi>thousand</hi> times that you desire above all things to know what that good, that perfect and acceptable will of his is. Let him know that you are so passionately bent to please him, that you would not stick, to purchase
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52888:24"/> the understanding of his pleasure at the rate of ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>housand Worlds, if it was in your disposal. This will prepare you</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> place to throw out that sluggish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which is in all our Natures, and to dispose your will with true fervour to attend this business of searching out the will of God. And <hi>next</hi> to this, I beseech you use the greatest diligence you can to provide that your <hi>Faith</hi> that is to do all things in your <hi>Journey,</hi> be not it self infected with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon disease of <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleness;</hi> be sure to purge your Soul from all the drowsie and <hi>Phlegmatique</hi> Opinions you may have about it, which <hi>stifle</hi> and <hi>choake</hi> the very Spirit and Life of it; suffer it not to rest till it animate you to a free and chearful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all God's holy Commands; let it give your Soul a sense that the <hi>whole of Religion</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this one powerful word, let it seem as a point from whence all the lines of your <hi>duty are drawn</hi> like a fire in the middle of a Room, sending out its heat on every side in an ardent love of God, and <hi>of your Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus effected this, then <hi>Fourthly,</hi> search your <hi>Conscience</hi> very narrowly to find out all the sins whereof you stand guilty, some of which may lurk so securely, or look so demurely, that a <hi>Faith</hi> which is not very <hi>busie,</hi> may either not espy them, or let them pass for no offences; these must all be purged out and left behind you, as things that can by no means be permitted to go along with you in your <hi>Journey,</hi> and for that end let me advise you to unload your soul of them all by humble <hi>Confession,</hi> and if any of them lie as an heavy burden upon you, to repair to the Spiritual <hi>Physitian,</hi> that he may help you by his counsel and prescriptions to ease you of them. But then take care that all these be attended with a strong resolution, that so tho your sins should <hi>follow</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52888:25"/> and <hi>call after you, when you are upon your Journey, and beg to have but one word with you,</hi> They shall be so far from receiving any entertainment, that you will not so much as enter into Speech with them, nor listen to the voice of any of their <hi>Temptations.</hi> For this you know undid no less than <hi>six hundred thousand Travellers to</hi> Jerusalem in antient times, and left all their Carkasses buried in the Desarts, who left <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you are now going to forsake the World; but it was in their bodies only, and not in their hearts and affections, their mouths watered still at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Flesh and Coleworts, the Garlick and Onions, and they had a secret inclination to return to those enjoyments which they had abandoned; therefore you must resolve to oppose every sin to wade through all difficulties, refuse no labours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to beg your bread, if without you cannot come safely there, this you must avow to be your mind, and you must confirm and ratifie it again and again, without any reservations, clauses or exceptions; and to this you must add, <hi>So help me, O my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 5ly be mindful of your home, and evermore have <hi>yonder glorious City</hi> in your eye to which you are travelling, Travellers use not to stand gazing or loitering on the way, or to be drawn aside to behold Novelties; they rise up early and come to their Inn late, and travel hard to get home-wards; nor are they satisfied till they reach it. And shall not we that are Christians, that are travelling to an Heavenly Country, be as mindful of our home; it being such a home, that as far transcends the state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest habitation here, as the highest heavens doth the lowest earth; such a home as the quickest and sharpest eye would be dazled with beholding but a Glimpse of its glory, and the eloquentest tongue or pen (that ever was) comes infinitely short to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it. The great Apostle (who had once a view
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52888:25"/> of that glory) comes something near in describing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, (but 'tis in the negative, what 'tis not, not what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tis:) for (saith he) Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, or the capacity of man apprehended the splendor of it. 'Tis such a home as all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets and Saints of God in all ages have left all to enquire after. This was the City to come, which they had ever in their Eye, and wandred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in Sheepskins and Goatskins, destitute, afflicted, and tormented to find out. 'Tis such a home where you shall never be troubled with any loathsome so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and your beloved company shall never be taken from you. No strugling of enemies there; no <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> to contend for one Crown; for none but Conquerors are there; all Heads shall be adorn'd with Crowns of Glory, such as never incircled the Temples of any earthly Mona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch. 'Tis such a home, where Satan, nor any of his instruments shall be ever able to molest; no siding or taking of parts there; no Schisms or Divisions; no room for Make-bates there: What should such Salamanders do in Heaven? there's a fitter place prepared for such hot Spirits, (&amp; 'twere well for them if one heat would extinguish another) for fire and brimstone must be the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Cup. This place is only for Friends to dwell together in unity, and none admitted here, but those that live in peace; here must be no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Contradiction, no dissentions or fallings out. 'Tis such a home, where you shall forthwith behold and enjoy the glorious beatifical Vision, and be eternally unridling that Mysterie which Mortality could never reach to, nor reason apprehend, the Tri-une God, the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity. There you shall see the Lamb with his train of Attendants, Cherubims, Seraphims, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, Powers, Thrones, Dominions, Archangels, and Angels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52888:26"/> and Confessors, crying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Sabbath:</hi> And there shall those good Angels which were your Guardians upon earth, be your everlasting Companions in Heaven. (In a word) 'tis such a home where you shall be made perfectly happy; Time shall not rust or diminish your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor adversity with her frowns, ever approach near those Mansions; for you shall be ever in the Sunshine of Gods favour, and your happiness as everlasting as his that made it.</p>
               <p>Oh! did but all <hi>transitory Pilgrims</hi> consider the shortness of the sweetest pleasure here, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of those endless and eternal joys that the Saints shall there partake of, and the shortness and small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the longest and greatest misery or torture that can be endured here in our passage to Glory, to the Worm that never dyes, to the fire that is never quencht, to those everlasting torments that shall in full viols be poured upon the wicked in Hell for ever; they would think less of this world, and more eagerly long to be travelling to a better.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Choose the <hi>best Guides</hi> you can get, when I have left you, to direct you in the way, for I must speedily depart from you. Choose such Guides which will lead you in the way to that home, to which many Saints are already gone in Soul, and many more shall in Gods due time arrive, and be fully glorified both in soul and body. These Seers and Overseers are those that open the Scriptures, or make plain the way of the Lord, and cause his paths to be known to the Sons of men; they are also (for their Dignity) termed Ambassadors of Christ, Christs Stewards, Publishers of glad Tidings, Proclaimers of Salvation, fellow-workers together with Christ, and Ministers of the Gospel. These God hath set up as lights, that by their soundness of Doctrine and integrity of Life, many souls may be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52888:26"/> recalled from darkness unto his marvelous light: they are Cities set upon a Hill for men to see, and Candles lighted upon Candlesticks to light the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller the way; and these (by their Eminency) are (or at least ought to be) Men of excellent Qualifications, and rare Endowments; (Angelical Persons, Men made up of Heaven) and if we take such for our Guides: we need not fear crooked paths, but may be confident of our way. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all is not Gold that glisters, nor all such as they seem, it behoves us to be very cautious in the choice of our Guides; for if the blind lead the blind, whither will they go? The way to Hell is braod and easily found, 'tis a pleasant way beset with Roses, able to entice the foolish Traveller, who is Ignorant that it leads to death. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the way to Heaven seems to flesh and blood very uncomfortable; a narrow, sharp, steep, and unpleasant way, very intricate, long tedious, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and hard to find; in which many a passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath stumbled, and many a blind Guide lost his way. But that we may be warned by others harms, and reach that which they fell short of; let's bear with the sharpness of the way, and be encouraged by the happiness of the end. The advice of a late ingenious Author, to this purpose, is worthy your observation. Regard not (saith he) how difficult the passage is, but whither it tends; nor how deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the journey is, but where it ends; if it be easie, suspect it; if hard, endure it. He that cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse a bad way, accuseth his own sloth; and he that sticks in a bad passage, can never attain a good jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end. It cannot be denied, but that many a passenger hath suffered by bad Guides, such as have let them go out of their way, and made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the pleasantest way was the best and the poor Traveller not sensible of the mistake, till it hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52888:27"/> been too late to talk of returning. But of such we are cautioned to beware; and tho they speak never so smoothly, <hi>This is the way, walk in it,</hi> we are to turn our deaf ear to the erring Charms of such blind Guides and witless Counsellors.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Set out betimes (when throughly instructed in the way you should go) and hold out to the end. And here I shall in the first place give Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to young Pilgrims who are just setting out in your Journey towards Heaven. And in the next, humbly address my self to aged Pilgrims, who are (or at least ought to be) near their Journeys end.</p>
               <p>And first to you young Pilgrims ah! let me request you to make God and Heaven the constant objects of your thoughts; the one of your fear, the other of your love; so walk that ye displease not the one, and ye need not fear the attaining of the other. Are you setting out for Heaven? Oh! lose no time, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that many have squandered away the morning, and have not reach'd their Journeys end er'e night; and with those foolish Virgins for their tardiness, have been excommunicated that place of repose, where the early Traveller safely and in good time arrived. An hour in the morning (you know) is worth two at night; and God is better pleased with young Zeal than decrepid Holiness. <hi>Josiah</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness makes him renown'd to posterity, and young <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Piety eternizes his name to future Generations. Are you on your way, persevere in your Christian Course, and think upon the end whilst ye are at the beginning, (and even now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the race, have an eye to the recompence) so shall the splendid glory of the one facilitate the the irksome tediousness of the other. Every true Christian (saith a learned Writer) is a Traveller: His Life, his walk; Christ his way, and Heaven his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52888:27"/> home; his walk painful, his way perfect, his home pleasing. Let's not therefore loiter, lest we come short of home; nor wander, lest we come wide of home; but be content to travel hard, and to be sure to walk aright, so shall our safe way find its end at home, and our painful walk, make our home wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. We are all concerned to make the best use of time, lest (too late) we lament the abuse of it; yesterdy cannot be recalled, to morrow cannot be assured, to day therefore is only ours, which if we slight, we lose; which if lost, is lost for ever. Young Pilgrims remember this, I mean you whose bodys are strong and healthful, not beset with any sickness, or besieged with any diseases, nor loaded with those common infirmities incident to old age, consider that you know not how short your time is, your Sun (for any thing you know) may go down in the morning, and your night may fall e're noon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be early up, and earnest on your way towards home; that if death should snatch you away in a moment, it may be, only to waft you to happiness, whilst ye are inquiring after it. <hi>David</hi> rose up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, and was earnest in his enquiries after this <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which you are travelling to, he longed after it, panted for it, and perpetually did he (during his tedious Pilgrimage in <hi>Mesech</hi>) lift up his hands, with his soul, towards it. The Father of the faithful rose up early too, and did chearfully set out, and held out to the end, as all those must do that hope to reach his bosom. But young Pilgrims i'le now leave you a while on your march, and after your good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning expect your perseverance in well doing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

And alas, my Foe, how neatly so ever thou now art tricked, trimmed, tyred and gallantly armed, yet thou art no more but <hi>Flesh:</hi> and know that <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the beauty thereof is as the <hi>flower</hi> of the <hi>Field.</hi> And therefore I'de have thee to know, I'll not be hindred in my Journey by thee, if I can subdue thee.</p>
               <p>But now give me leave to talk a little with thee, O deceitful <hi>Flesh!</hi> And first resolve me, if ever I came into any place before I began my Travels to the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> wherein I could promise to my self peace. Nay even in this populous City of <hi>Silesia,</hi> I cannot take my walk in any Screet, wherein I am not subject to be taken by thy alluring deceit. Thou sendest forth those two <hi>light Spies,</hi> to purvey and bring in Objects of lust; by these am I wounded, by these do I suffer a continual <hi>Combat.</hi> Neither are these wounds cured yet; tho' my youth has left me; and tho' the daily Messengers of Death sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon me. For, tho I be nearer my <hi>Grave,</hi> I fear I am little richer in <hi>Grace.</hi> Tho those follies of my youth have now left me- (and wo is me that I did not leave them before they left me) yet other aged maladies grow strong in me; against which I must prepare my self for the encounter, or I am undone for ever. Would you hear what my Distempers are They are these: Tho few be my hours; hoary my hairs (and my Journey long I have to go by a setting Sun) yet am I as numerous in my worldly cares, as if I were but even now entring into the World. I cannot without an envious eye see my Neighbours Field flourish; others prosperity gives me occasion of repining: others adversity grounds of rejoycing. Honour I would have, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52888:35"/>
               <p>And alas, tho now in my Pilgrimage I carry about me constant Companions of Mortality, as <hi>Aches, Agues,</hi> Cramps and Coughs, which are the Livery of a travelling Pilgrim, and tho <hi>Death</hi> waits at the Wicket, and lies in Ambush in what House soever I lodge, and in what path soever I walk, to seize me, or to bid me come away, and leave the <hi>World,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a Shrowding Sheet; yet have I a months mind to be greater, or richer, or more eminent in the eyes of others, as if I could dispense with age, or make a truce with death; and all this is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by thy false suggestions, Oh sinful flesh.</p>
               <p>Therefore oh sigh and groan poor unhappy <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> take thy self now into the Ballance; weigh and examine thy self: Let not one hour pass over thee without a sigh; not a minute without a sob. Take away the force of this <hi>Engine,</hi> this fearful <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silisk,</hi> with incessant Rivers of tears: Thou hast yet a little time left thee; bestow not one moment of it, but to Gods glory. See how every minute thou art nearer unto death; how the Messengers of the Grave tell thee thou canst not live long. There is not the least grain of sand which passeth through this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit of thine Hour-glass, but may assure thee that thou art hasting on to the Sepulcher of thy Fathers. Canst thou then find any time to game, play and sport thy self, or to hearken to the Temptations of <hi>World</hi> or <hi>Flesh.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Shewing what Assaults the poor Pilgrim suffer'd by the <hi>Devil,</hi> both in company and in private.</head>
               <p>BUt I had no sooner utter'd these words, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on a sudden, I had pretty well gotten the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52888:35"/> mastery over the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and so I takes up my Staff and travels on again, imagining the third Enemy the Devil was fled, seeing how resolutely I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered the <hi>World and Flesh;</hi> but I was mistaken, for it seems he lay all the while in secret, and I did not go half the length of a Field further before he rushes out of a private corner and Assaults me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a most furious manner, telling me tho the <hi>World and Flesh</hi> had been abused by me after a Dirty sort, yet he would not, and that he would, tho he was forced to raise all the evil Spirits under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, obstruct me in my Travels, and leave me sprawling on the ground. (Hearing him say thus, I ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed all my courage that I had left together, and thus bespake him, <hi>O thou envious one, was it not sufficient for thee to lose thy self by thy</hi> Pride; <hi>but like a cruel cunning</hi> Nimrod, <hi>thou must hunt day and night after innocent blood. 'Tis true, Thou art for ever lost, and thou wouldst have my poor soul in the same state. And to bring thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose about, thou hast practised with the people of my own Family, to betray my</hi> Fort <hi>unto the Enemy. Thou hast winnowed me: and as thou foundst me affected, thou wroughtst upon me. Thou hadst</hi> Baits <hi>in store for every soul, to take him napping in his Darling sin.</hi> If thou foundst him labour of that <hi>Birth</hi> wherein thou pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishedst, thou couldst suggest to him thoughts of his own abilities; bring him to a disdain of others. Tell him, the Country did not take sufficient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his worth. Advise him to hold an higher opinion of himself: and by contemning others, to raise his own estimate. But whereto aim all these trains? to undo him; for being fed with these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, he begins to aspire to places of Honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in being crossed of his hopes, he falls into discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which closeth the unhappy Scene of his life in misery and contempt. Or being deprived of what he once enjoyed, he is to an unexpected thraldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52888:36"/> and so with the heavy memory of his former sweet felicity, and present misery, he either lives desperately encountred with those affrighting thoughts of danger, or takes his leave at once both of life and honour.</p>
               <p>Again, if thou foundst him <hi>Covetous,</hi> thou hadst <hi>Achans</hi> wedge, and <hi>Geheza</hi>'s treasure in readiness for him: He shall have his <hi>desires</hi> and a <hi>Leprosie</hi> to boot. If <hi>riotous,</hi> the <hi>Rich-mans</hi> table could not be better furnished, his delicious and liquorish appetite must be satisfied: nothing wanting that may tend to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, but with those <hi>Rioters</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> he little knows how near he is perishing. If <hi>Lascivious,</hi> his flesh must want no provocation, to bring this deluded Minion to destruction. Fancies by night, and more visible Objects by day, are sent forth to seise on his pleased heart, and make him forgetfull of God. If <hi>Passionate,</hi> he shall find motives enough to inrage him; nothing he sees can content him. Fury is in his Eyes, and revenge in his Heart. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters cannot quench this heat: for he aims at nothing but death. If <hi>Envious,</hi> others success finds him matter enough to work on. It is hard to say, whether his own gain or others loss please him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Those walks in fair flourishing fields which are made to recreate others, are justly made to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate himself. For to see his Neighbours ground prosper, begets in him a distemper. If <hi>sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> the Summer-beams, though they shine never so gloriously upon him, must not rouze him: there is an <hi>Adder</hi> in the way: <hi>yet a little, and then a little,</hi> makes him forget his <hi>poverty.</hi> If Heaven may be got by security, he may be secure of it for Eternity. But the purchase of Heaven is no such easie task.</p>
               <p>But thus, thus thou profest Enemy of mankind, assaultst him: and according to every occasion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parest thy temptation. And of all others, <hi>I poor
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52888:36"/> Pilgrim,</hi> became in these most miserable. For lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knew I thy subtilty, my weakness and infirmity. Whence it was, that formerly finding me no less ready to assent, than thou wert to assault, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest my own <hi>Family</hi> thy <hi>Garrison</hi> to keep that <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fort</hi> which thou hadst like to have won from me.</p>
               <p>But now I'll be no more deluded and entrapped by thee, therefore fly Satan, fly; upon which words he vanisht.</p>

                  <p>Shewing how the Pilgrim called at a poor thatcht Cottage that lay in his way to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with an account how after he departed thence, be met with a <hi>Beggar,</hi> and pious <hi>Knight</hi> upon the Road, that were both desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to see the <hi>Celestial City,</hi> with his Discourses with them: then <hi>how again</hi> after this he had lik't to have lost his way in a little green Field, had not a <hi>fair Damsel,</hi> whose name was <hi>Piety,</hi> given him Directions: with <hi>an account</hi> likewise, how after this he falls into Company with other <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with himself (being misguided and deceived by a treacherous speech the Devil made to them in the shape of a tall handsome man) travel into the <hi>Destructive City</hi> called <hi>Debauchery,</hi> where they had like to have been destroyed and burnt alive, but that one called <hi>sincere Repentance,</hi> and several other <hi>honest Souls</hi> hastily came to their assistance, and delivered them out of this <hi>City,</hi> and set them in their right way again that lead to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> with the manner how after this they met with several other Persons with there Discourses with them, and then how at last the <hi>poor Pilgrim,</hi> first spoken of, lost all his fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers (by their sudden Deaths,) with the manner how after that he was forced to travel to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> all alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many weighty things besides.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter these encounters I began to be very thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, I therefore resolved at the next <hi>Country Village</hi> I came to, to call call for a little cool water to refresh me, but seeing a Thatcht Cottage on this side the next Town I was to pass through, I called there, and entring into the House I found a knot of loving Neighbours at a frugal Dinner, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to feast one another more with their mutual good
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52888:37"/> Conversation, than with any other Chear that was provided; their eyes told that they were very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that there was a true love in their Hearts; their Countenance and free Converse did plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare there was nothing superfluous, but all very handsom, no looseness but great freedom, no noise but much innocent pleasure; they were disposed to mirth rather than joy, to chearfulness rather than jollity, and to entertain themselves with a grateful variety rather than with abundance of meat and drink: this sight did very much affect me, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had called for a little <hi>Beer of Natures Brewing</hi> to squench my thirst, I began to discourse with them in praise of Temperance, Sobriety and other laudable Vertues, but I had not been there above a quarter of an hour before I had an inkling that those three Enemies, that I last encountred with, were again upon the search for me, upon hearing of which I took my leave of those loving Neighbours and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on again apace towards the <hi>Celestial City;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times crossing the Seas and great Waters that lay in my way thither, and sometimes again clambering up Huge Hills and Lofty Mountains, resolving now that no danger or difficulty whatsoever should retard my <hi>journey</hi> towards the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> forasmuch as I had had so man, hindrances hitherto, at last I came to an odd <hi>amphibious Country,</hi> indented all up and down with <hi>Rivers</hi> and Arms of the <hi>Sea,</hi> that I made a <hi>question</hi> whether I should call it <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi> yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As I wandred up and down in this <hi>Watry Region,</hi> I might behold from a strait long <hi>Dike</hi> whereon I stood, a strange kind of <hi>Forrest,</hi> for the <hi>Trees</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up and down; they looked afar off as if they had been blasted by Thunder, for they had no <hi>leaves</hi> at all, but making a nearer approach unto them, I found they were a numberless company of <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masts,</hi> and before them appeared a great <hi>Town</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated up and down with Water. As I mused with my self, upon the sight of all this, I concluded that the Inabitants of the Country were notable <hi>Industrious</hi> People, who could so busie themselves upon the <hi>angry Ocean,</hi> and occupy those places where the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> should tumble and take his <hi>pastime</hi> in. As my thoughts <hi>ran</hi> thus, I met with a man who I conjectured to be betwixt a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> and a <hi>Marriner;</hi> his salutation was so <hi>affable and kind,</hi> the Air also was so foggy that methought it stuck like Cobwebs on his Beard, and he was so dull in point of motion, as if his Veins had been fill'd with Buttermilk in <hi>leiu</hi> of Blood; when he was come up close to me, <hi>he askt me who I was, and whither I was going; I told him I was a melancholy Pilgrim, travelling all alone to another world, being weary of this:</hi> upon which demand of his I began to mingle words with him, and to expostulate something about this Country, and the People that dwelt therein, and indeed I sound a great deal of <hi>downright Civility</hi> from him. But as he was giving me an impartial <hi>Relation</hi> of this <hi>Country,</hi> and the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Inhabitants,</hi> he suddenly broke the thread of his discourse, and got <hi>hastily</hi> away from me, being haled by a Ship that was sailing hard by us, which troubled me a little to think I should so unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lose <hi>so sweet a Companion,</hi> but I had not walkt a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long farther onwards of my <hi>Journey</hi> to Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I kenn'd a <hi>certain Beggar</hi> all in ragged Cloaths,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52888:38"/> not worth three-half-pence, with sad dirty feet (he being without either Shoes or Stockins) travelling, as I perceived, in the very road that led to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> upon which I called out aloud, <hi>So Ho! So Ho! Honest Fellow,</hi> whither are you travelling so fast, if you'l but stay till I come up to you, if you are going my way, I will bear you company with all my heart to the end of your <hi>Journey.</hi> The <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> hearing me say thus, he looked back to see who it was that call'd after him, and resolves to stand stock still till I was come up quite to him, so when I was arrived, I thus saluted him,</p>

                  <p>Truly Sir I will do it willingly, thou Sir, didst wish me a prosperous and good Morning, and I answered I never had an unprosperous or evil one; for when I am pinched with <hi>hunger</hi> I praise God: if I suffer <hi>cold,</hi> if it <hi>hail,</hi> if it <hi>snow,</hi> if it <hi>rain,</hi> if the weather be <hi>fair</hi> or <hi>foul</hi> in my Travels I praise God: if I be <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>despised</hi> I likewise praise God:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52888:39"/> and therefore there never happened any <hi>sad</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> morning to me.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou saidst moreover that God would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make me <hi>happy;</hi> whereunto I likewise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that I had never been <hi>unhappy;</hi> for I am fully resolved through his Grace to adhere, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cleave to the will of God as the best, (as abandoning mine own will) into which I have so wholy poured out mine own will, that whatever he wills that I will also, and for this cause as I said, I was never <hi>unhappy,</hi> seeing that I will cleave to his will only, and have wholly resigned mine own proper will.</p>

                  <p>Drown me in the <hi>Bottomless Pit!</hi> why certainly if he should, I have <hi>two Arms</hi> by which I would still imbrace him, and clasp fast about him: one is <hi>true humility,</hi> and that I lay under him, and by him I am united to his most sacred humanity; the other, and that is the right <hi>Arm,</hi> which is <hi>Love,</hi> which is united to his Divinity, and by this Love given to me from himself I hold him so fast, that he would be forced to go down to Hell with me, and it were much more to be wished by me to be in Hell with God, than to be in Heaven without him.</p>
                  <p>By this I learned, that the most compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way to God is a <hi>true resignation</hi> with <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

                  <p>After this we hasted away as fast as we could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a little Town called <hi>Religion,</hi> which lay in the direct way to the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> (still bearing in our minds the <hi>Delectable Mountains,</hi> where we were told by the <hi>Lady Faith</hi> we should both meet with refreshment, and get a prospect of our <hi>Heavenly Country.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>But Oh! with what difficulty did we pass along the Country, for the Devil pursued us close still, so that the <hi>first day</hi> we escap'd the <hi>Moat,</hi> we were forced to mount a mighty <hi>Hill called Opposition;</hi> and here we were stopt, not only by <hi>Infernal Spirits,</hi> and a whole Regiment of <hi>Hellish Temptations,</hi> but the <hi>Country People</hi> also were stirred up by some that were profest Enemies to our precious souls to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us in our flight, and to turn us back again if possible into the <hi>City Debauchery,</hi> yet for all this (by the providence of God) we got up the Mountain: but the next day we fell down into a deep Valley called <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and so difficult a passage this was that we were scarce able to pass through it, and yet we saw there was no other way to the <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi> But being got through it, we presently came to a certain <hi>Stile</hi> (which we perceived would also put us hard to it to get over) it being called the stile of <hi>Carnal Reason,</hi> but we not consulting with <hi>flesh and Blood,</hi> made little of it and jumpt over it.</p>
                  <p>But alas! we were not gone a <hi>Pole</hi> from the Stile before we came into an <hi>howling Wilderness,</hi> through which <hi>Theologus</hi> had formerly told us we must pass,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52888:47"/> and here we seemed for a while to be at a stand, there being so many turnings and by-ways: and our chief <hi>Enemies</hi> to amuse us raised up several <hi>subtil Impostors</hi> to put us again out of the <hi>right path</hi> that led to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> one crying this is the <hi>Road</hi> and another that: besides we were assured the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> had many deep and dangerous Pits in it, and that also 'twas very <hi>dark and dolesome,</hi> all which we found to be true, so that if we had not met some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before with an able and <hi>honest Guide</hi> who gave us Directions how we should walk over it, with Cautions also how to avoid the dangerous places, doubtless we had perisht in this place.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Truth</hi> now being our only <hi>Conductor,</hi> whose counsel always (as 'twas contained in the <hi>Holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>) we resolved to follow, we went not a foot out of our way through this dangerous place. But as it fell out two or three days after we were gone over the Wilderness we met with many <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and other <hi>evil Beasts,</hi> yet we passed securely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they having no power to hurt us, though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on first sight of them we were possest with great fears that they would, but the <hi>Lady Grace</hi> travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling some part of the rest of the way with us she vanquisht these <hi>doubts</hi> and desponding thoughts.</p>
                  <p>But, yet the worst was not over, for lo! on a sudden we were beset with <hi>Thieves</hi> who threatned to knock us on the head, (but were restrained) yet they robbed us of all our <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and part of that little money (we had left) upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we were forced to travel stark naked five miles farther onwards of our way to a <hi>Gentlemans House</hi> that stood by a River side, where we begg'd (and obtain'd) a few rags to cover our nakedness the remaining part of our journey.</p>
                  <p>And now though these <hi>hardships</hi> we met with after we were robb'd (of our Cloaths and mony) from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52888:47"/> the <hi>Wind and Weather</hi> were irksome to flesh and blood, yet we calling to mind how wonderfully God had delivered us from <hi>sin and Satan, mattered none of all these things,</hi> for now to our inconceivable joy and comfort we were come into the sweet and pleasant way of the <hi>New Covenant:</hi> and at last get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up upon the top of an <hi>high Rock</hi> called the <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> we were safe enough; and here we had a full view (when we looked downwards) of the miserable City of <hi>Debauchery</hi> which we so lately, to the hazzard of our lives, past through, and when we looked upwards we saw (to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing of our hearts) the glory of that <hi>Heavenly Country</hi> we were going to. After this we all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther steered our course <hi>(through a most delicious Country)</hi> to another <hi>City</hi> that was nothing else but a kind of Posie made up of dainty <hi>green Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,</hi> and tyed together by above four hundred <hi>Bridges,</hi> (but it lay in our way to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) and therefore we were all forced to go through it, which we did without any stay or hindrance in the least: from this City in an <hi>instant</hi> we ferried over a-long and dangerous <hi>Gulf,</hi> and so through a <hi>Midland Sea</hi> into another <hi>Kingdom,</hi> where we felt the <hi>Clime</hi> hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by some degrees, than we had done all along in our <hi>Travells</hi> hitherto: for the most part this Country was a rough hewn soil and full of <hi>craggy barren Hills,</hi> upon which account all our <hi>walks</hi> here were rendred very unpleasant, but where there were <hi>Vallies</hi> and <hi>Water enough</hi> the Country was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Fruitful,</hi> whereby nature it seems made her a <hi>compensation</hi> for the stirrility of the rest. As we rov'd here a while we encountred a grave man in <hi>black cloaths,</hi> we closed with him, and questioned him about that Country, and how far he thought we might have yet to the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> he told us he himself was wholly a stranger to that <hi>Country</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52888:48"/> we enquired after, and he could not tell us, but he said, he believed we had many thousand miles to it yet.</p>
                  <p>So we took our leaves of him and travelled far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as we wandered up and down in the Wilderness of this World, at last we chanced to come to a small <hi>Village,</hi> at the furthermost end of which <hi>(upon the Common)</hi> we espied a little Cottage, a poor old ruinous thing it was, the Windows being all broke, only they had cramb'd into the holes some old rags to keep out the cold, and by the propping of it up it seemed as if it were ready to fall, but however we remembring what <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> formerly said, <hi>viz. that the poor receive the Gospel,</hi> and it now beginning to grow towards night we resolved to go thither and see whether we might not be refreshed there with sleep and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for one night, and have directions both how far we had to go (for we began again now to be at a loss) and which was our nearest way to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> And being come up to the Door, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that the <hi>poor mans</hi> name who dwelt there was one <hi>Lackmony,</hi> now we knocked five or six times before we could have any manner of answer, for it seems he was asleep in bed with his Wife, but at last being between sleeping and waking he asked (though very faintly) <hi>Who is there, who is at the Door?</hi>

                     <p>We all listned very diligently, but could not hear what <hi>Lackmony</hi> said by reason of the noise that was within, for he having many <hi>Children</hi> it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that by this time they were waked and fell into a fit of crying, some wanted Victuals and some of

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52888:50"/> that there was a <hi>Summons</hi> sent for them all immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to appear before the <hi>Great King of Heaven:</hi> But they were not at all startled at the News, but as soon as I had told them, took me all by the hand one after another, and said, Well, <hi>Dear Pilgrim,</hi> now it seems then, we must leave thee, but we all heartily thank thee for thy good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Counsel hetherto, and we hope it will not be long before thou comest to the end of thy Pilgrimage, that so we may meet thee once again, &amp; that too likewise when thou art walking in the Streets of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> where we shall enjoy thy sweet Company for ever: Therefore hold out as couragiously to the end as thou hast done hitherto, and trample down all oppositions, for he that holds out to the end shall for ever enjoy that Crown that we are just going to possess. But when I had heard them say so, I said to them thus, Dear fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, are you not afraid of that River called Death, through which we must pass to enjoy this happiness; to which they answered No, no, not in the least; For alas man, said they, we are now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> where all sorrow and sadness shall fly away; and tho with great difficulty we got safe hither, yet now none of us all do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of that trouble we went through to arrive to that hope of Heaven, which we have now in our own Breasts.</p>
                  <p>When the very hour was come that they were to <hi>go hence and be seen no more on Earth,</hi> I accompany'd them to the River side through which they were to pass to the other World. As they first stept into the River, they all of them made a loving <hi>Beck'n</hi> of <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> to me, and presently after cry'd out, <hi>Oh Death where is thy Sting;</hi> and as they went down still deeper and deeper, they said, <hi>Oh Grave where is thy Victory!</hi> And so they passed gloriously over, <hi>Trumpets sounding for them on the other side.</hi>

If there be any particular friendships there, they do not at all spoil the universal kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the place, others will not be loved the worse for them but rather the better; and after the pleasures of a more general and large conversation, every one may retire to the delightful company of those he loveth most: There you will be met with such shining lights as St. <hi>Paul.

               <p>With which answer, they seeming to be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I left mine Arbour, and took them in with me; preparing such things for them as might refresh t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>how far their Dominions were enlarged, with divers other tempting alurements; the discovery whereof so much delighted me, as I desired nothing more than with more freedom yet to enjoy their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: resolving to importune their stay for a long time with me: and to my request they inclined readily. Albeit they told me, that during their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing with me, they must sometimes of necessity crave my pardon, to resort to divers of their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> especial Customers, as Painters, Perfumers, Periwig-makers, Usurers, Alehouse-keepers, with others; to the end they might keep their hands in ure, and their brains awork, to shape a Coat for the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52888:71"/> Moon, and bring the world into a new fashion. And to the end they might the better do me a courtesie for my late hospitality; these obliging expressions of theirs so strangely madded me with the thoughts of bravery, and all manner of pleasures, that I thought now I should instantly enjoy, as I became wholly theirs, chearfully embracing whatsoever they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me: And within a short time now I became such a Vassal to them, as I thought any service well bestowed that I could do for them.</p>
               <p>Thus, thus became I poor Pilgrim (whilst I was on my way to heaven) assaulted; thus became I foiled. But why do I inveigh against their treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, I became to my self the most treacherous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? For by yielding my <hi>Fort</hi> to the spirit of <hi>Pride,</hi> my chiefest glory grew darkned. By entertaining <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi> my former content vanished. By cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lechery,</hi> both mine inward and outward faculties were disabled. By feeding <hi>Envy,</hi> it became a feeder of me, and so my spirits became wasted. By cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Gluttony,</hi> my spiritual infirmities were strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. By harbouring <hi>Wrath,</hi> charity the choicest comfort of Christian society was banished. By fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering <hi>Sloath,</hi> out of my <hi>great Masters check-roule,</hi> became my name to be razed. Neither were these unthankful Guests so contented; for by their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous attempts, became my <hi>Cinque ports</hi> endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So as, those darlings of mine which had they been loyally affected, should have been my assistants, proved to be my private assassinates. Not one of them but they failed in performing those due offices to which they were deputed. My <hi>eye,</hi> indeed, knew how to look, but by wandring it correpted my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding with the thoughts of lust. My <hi>ear</hi> knew how to hear, but by hearing amiss it distracted the intention of mine heart. My <hi>nostrils</hi> knew how to smell, but by rejecting those flowers of divine sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52888:71"/> I begun to snuffe up the wind with the <hi>wild Asse</hi> in the wilderness. My <hi>touch</hi> knew how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her offiice, but by touching unclean things, or by using clean things uncleanly, that sense became enslaved to all sensuality. <hi>My mouth became an open Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre mine heart sins harbour.</hi> What then could this poor razed Fort of my surprized soul expect but utter ruine, misery and desolation? Foes wrought one me without: and fears seazed on me within. I had none left to comfort me: for my best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I had deservingly estranged from me; For had I not with <hi>Demas</hi> left God for the world, I might have had God for my Friend all along to the end of my pilgrimage. In this <hi>streight</hi> I knew not what to do, for to go now any further I was extreamly afraid, having so basely hugg'd in my very bosom, seven men that were utter enemies to that glorious City, I had been all this while travelling to, and to go back <hi>(after I had made such a large progress towards Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem)</hi> I was asham'd; I therefore at last resolved at the next <hi>shady Hedge</hi> I came unto, to kneel down under it and go to <hi>Prayers,</hi> remembring how mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously <hi>Prayer</hi> had delivered me formerly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Pilgrims that were then in my company, out of several unspeakable Dangers, that we encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with in the City <hi>Debauchery,</hi> when nothing else could help us: so when I came to the <hi>Tree,</hi> I knelt down, and before I had prayed for the space of half an hour, I perceived all my seven Enemies were fled, whereupon I immediately arose from off my <hi>Knees,</hi> and got my self discharged of my <hi>new hired house,</hi> (sor I perceived it to be a place very lyable to Thieves and Robbers) and so I takes up my <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims staff</hi> again, and travelled further, hoping that at last I should come to my <hi>Journeys end,</hi> tho by a <hi>Prospective Glass</hi> I had in my hand, I perceived I had a long and dangerous way yet to travel, before I could arrive there.</p>

And further put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her in remembrance of a former alliance and neighbourly commerce held and continued between his <hi>Lord Virtuoso,</hi> and her deceased Father, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death-bed motioned a <hi>Contract of Marriage</hi> between them; which if she would stand unto, then a large <hi>dowry</hi> should be ratified under his hand and seal to her, and the heirs of their two bodies for ever, <hi>&amp;.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Embassie</hi> ended, she briefly thus replyed, Sir you that spake last I answer, <hi>first</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>I find not my self enjoyned by my <hi>deceased Fathers</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52888:73"/> Will, to any such contract upon a penalty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hold my self free to mine own will.</p>
               <p>But seeing it is so that both your Lords profess love (as you say) unto me, and each offereth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry largely, I thank them both; and that I might know which loveth me best, I will that he that can approve himself most Puissant and truly Valiant by the others <hi>Conquest,</hi> shall be <hi>Lord of me and mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Answer returned (as fast as <hi>Imagination</hi> could carry them) away they went to their Lords: who understanding her resolution, though they were both doubtful of their success <hi>(for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lay partly in her affecting)</hi> yet they resolved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding on both sides to try the event.</p>
               <p>Then Lord <hi>Virtuoso</hi> speedily despatcht three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, <hi>Reason, Descretion</hi> and good <hi>Remembrance</hi> to solicit her the second time: And so did <hi>Pharo Neco Vitioso:</hi> viz. <hi>Temptation, Folly</hi> and <hi>Sensuality</hi> to use their best devoir to draw her to their parts.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Madam Cogitations</hi> stood fully resolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>fight first,</hi> and then as she saw occasion so she would conclude.</p>
               <p>Being out of all hope on either side to obtain her favourable aspect, (which would be very further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the party affected) they prepare to the Battle: but the night before <hi>Don Vitioso,</hi> like a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty old Knave sent his sworn servant <hi>Sinior Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> secretly (like a Spie) to sow his slippery seed all over the Field, that Lord <hi>Virtuoso</hi> his Souldiers should not be able to stand, their ground should be so slippery.</p>
               <p>Now this right worthy Lord <hi>Virtuoso</hi> very early the next morning <hi>preparing to Battle:</hi> Thus march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward with his whole army; himself sitting in an <hi>Ivory Chariot</hi> richly garnished with <hi>Gold, Pearls and precious stones:</hi> there attending on the Chariot four worthy Knights: viz. <hi>Righteousness, Prudence,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52888:73"/> Strength</hi> and <hi>Temperance:</hi> Next to the Chariot Rode seven Captains.</p>
               <p>The first was <hi>Humility</hi> riding on a <hi>Lamb,</hi> on his helm a Faulcon gentil stood.</p>
               <p>Next him followed <hi>Charity</hi> riding on a <hi>Tiger,</hi> who who carried a Pellican on his helm.</p>
               <p>The third was <hi>Patience</hi> on a Camel, he had on his Crest a <hi>Phenix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth was <hi>Liberality</hi> on a Dromedary, and on his Crest an <hi>Ospra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth was <hi>Abstinence</hi> riding on a Hart, on his helm a <hi>Popiniay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sixth was <hi>Chastity,</hi> who bestrid an Unicorn, on his a Crest Turtle Dove was placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good Exercise</hi> was the seventh, who was mounted on a <hi>Panther:</hi> and a Crane he had on his Crest.</p>
               <p>Many petty Captains there were besides, as <hi>Pitty, Meekness, Goodness, Concord, Ʋnity, Patience, Honesty, true Friendship, Simplicity, Stedfastness, Quietness, Peaceablenss, Helpfulness, Discreetness, Serviceableness, Compassion, Good-order, Justice, Contentedness, Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Foresightfulness, Contemplation, Reverence, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, Indifferency, Lowlyness, Affection,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All these befere they march'd were dub'd Kinghts by their General <hi>Don Virtuoso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Vicioso</hi> also dub'd other 24 Knights of the <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haste,</hi> to animate them two to the conquest of the <hi>Gilt Spurs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cunning</hi> also brought to the aid of <hi>Don Virtuoso</hi> certain Companies whose Captains were <hi>Nigro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, Geomancy, Magick, Adriomancy, Physiognomy, Palmestry, Ornomancy and Piromancy:</hi> but <hi>Tresnoble Virtue</hi> (scarce thanking him for his offer) told him that he never used (nor would) any such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the wars.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Cunning,</hi> with his Consorts being thus casheir'd, went to <hi>Don Vicioso,</hi> who (with all respect)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52888:74"/> gladly received him and his Comrages, and placed them in his rereward all on Horse-back, and Crown'd them with Bays; and behold now in my Dream me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I saw <hi>Vicioso,</hi> as a glorious Conqueror, leading the numerous hosts, like a victorious General, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, under <hi>Apollion,</hi> King of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pit, having thousands following him, with great shouts, Musick of all sorts, and loud acclamations, crying, <hi>great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the World.</hi> Now as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the martial order they marched in, against Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Cogitation and the precious Soul of man; take this briefly, first <hi>Tyrant Sin</hi> led the <hi>Van,</hi> (being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more than an hundred thousand strong.)</p>
               <p>Next to him marcht <hi>Apollion,</hi> mighty <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> heading <hi>three great Armies,</hi> composed of different kinds; yet all cruel Enemies to the Soul: The first consisted of the <hi>riches</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi> by which thousands have fallen: the second of <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>sinful Preferments:</hi> The third was filled up with <hi>vain delights</hi> and <hi>pleasures:</hi> they are also called by three other names, viz. <hi>the lust of the Eyes, the lust of the Flesh, and the pride of Life. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these,</hi> followed a man <hi>(if we may call him so)</hi> adorned in <hi>Cloath of Gold,</hi> with a <hi>tripple Crown</hi> on his head; and for a <hi>Scepter,</hi> a brace of <hi>Keys</hi> in his hand; who in my dream I took to be the great King of <hi>Babylon, Innocent</hi> the 11th, with a glorious reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of <hi>Cardinals, Abbots, Friars, Monks, Nuns, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,</hi> and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and a number more following these, with a great train of <hi>Artillery;</hi> as, <hi>merit of Works, Limbus Patrum, Purgatory, Pardons, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, Vows, Prayers to, and for the Dead, Penance, Holy Water, Pilgrims, Auricular Confessions, extream Ʋnction, Lamps, Candles, Torches, Tapers, Relicts, Oyl, Salt, Spittle, Crucifixes, Beads, Holy Garments, Signs, Gestures, Canons, Customs,</hi> and the Lord knows
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52888:74"/> what besides, as <hi>Blood, Slaughter, Massacres, Stake, Fire and Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> or the proud and blasphemous <hi>Emperor of Turkey,</hi> attended with his chief <hi>Mufty,</hi> and a multitude of other inferiour Priests, with their <hi>Alcoran</hi> in their hand, and a great Army at their <hi>Heels,</hi> with <hi>Swords,</hi> and other <hi>slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering weapons,</hi> swearing by their <hi>Beards,</hi> what they would do to all such that opposed them; being all true Sons and Vassels of <hi>Apollion;</hi> and this dreadful enemy <hi>Tyrant Sin</hi> who was the Lieutenant General of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>And then after these, an Army of <hi>fair Ladies</hi> drest in Samptuous Apparel, and in the newest Modes the City <hi>Debauchery</hi> hath of late found out; as spotted Faces, naked Breasts and Shoulders, beckoning to all the <hi>wanton Striplings,</hi> which they saw as they marched along to the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, saying, <hi>Come Boys, stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come</hi> therefore, Oh! come along with us, for we have deckt Beds for you, with Coverings of Tapestry, and carved works, embroidered with the fine Linnen of <hi>Egypt;</hi> we have likewise perfumed them too with Myrhe Alloes, and Cinamon, come, make no demur, but go along with us, and let us take our sills of Love till the Morning, at which time we shall all march out in good array against all that opposes our <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual and lovely pleasures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then again after these marched a number of <hi>debauched Lads</hi> out of <hi>Youth-shire,</hi> armed Cap-a-pee, being as true as steel to the interest of their <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and very expert, methoughts in my Dream they seemed to be in all stratagems of War against <hi>God, Christ,</hi> and <hi>true Godliness.</hi> These taring Lads had a <hi>glittering Coach</hi> to attend them, which was drawn by four Horses called <hi>Rashness, Luxury, Spendall</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52888:75"/>
                  <hi>Folly,</hi> (their Coachman being the <hi>Devil</hi>) and one whom the Country people called <hi>Beggary,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts I saw ride behind, and although the Coach did run a thundring pace, and these Lads did seem to be secure, yet there was abundance of folks, as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Mercers, Booksellers, Silkmen</hi> and <hi>Taylors,</hi> &amp;c. that did pursue them with cruel <hi>long Bills,</hi> so that for their courage in fighting for <hi>Tyrant Sin</hi> against the soul of man, they are like to pay dearly.</p>
               <p>But moreover, besides these there was a bloody and treacherous Brigade, who did lie in secret Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado, who were as dangerous as any of the rest, called <hi>Inbred Corruptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Reer marched two Regiments, the first was made up of a base sort of Varlets called <hi>Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, i. e.</hi> being such as have deserted the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Profession,</hi> and have joyned in with the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The last was a Regiment of strange people, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two of them being alike, and their Manners and Customs were as various, they come out of a <hi>Town</hi> which lies on one side of the <hi>City of God,</hi> called <hi>Heresie,</hi> and therefore may fitly be called <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>seditious Sectaries,</hi> being rotten at heart, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in the fundamentals of <hi>the true Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> holding almost every abominable <hi>principle</hi> that hath been broached by the Devil in any Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus War being proclamed, and all the forces of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>darkness</hi> mustered, a <hi>Councel</hi> was called to consult about the best expedients to carry it on, and there being neither power nor pollicy wanting, what can we think to be the issue of it, but <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>slaughter</hi> to the soul of man.</p>
               <p>And therefore to be brief, on both sides they ranged their main Battalions, and <hi>Vicioso Abbadono</hi> most couragiously gave the first onset, discharging his great Ordnance (which was basterd Cannons in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52888:75"/> all his Army) which the Lord <hi>Grace</hi> (who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Vanguard of the Prince <hi>Virtuoso</hi>'s Army) avoided by the help of a rising Hill on the <hi>Southeast</hi> side, and intrenched on the <hi>Northeast</hi> side, well manned and maintained by right puisant <hi>Patience</hi> and heavenly <hi>Humility:</hi> so that all their small shot past over their heads without any detriment.</p>
               <p>Then they drew near, their Enemy scirmiging with their small shot, which the Lord <hi>Virtuoso</hi>'s party manly bore off with their Targets of Proof, not yeilding one foot; joyning Battle, they fell to it <hi>pell mell,</hi> with such fury, that many were slain, many wounded, and many taken Prisoners on both sides: But the wicked weed that <hi>Sensuality</hi> had sown, made the ground so slippery, that Lord <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoso</hi>'s company could not stand; which <hi>Infidelity</hi> (standing on the left hand of Madam <hi>Cogitations</hi>) perceiving, inticed her to learn to <hi>Vicioso Apolliono</hi>'s party: But true <hi>Faith</hi> on the right side counselled her to the contrary, but all in vain, for she not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured <hi>Mounsier Gogmagogo Vicioso,</hi> but took part with him also.</p>
               <p>All which, Lord <hi>Virtuoso</hi> perceiving, in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content left the Field for that time; and <hi>Signior Gracioso</hi> commanded a retreat to be sounded: <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godomado Viciofissimo</hi> hearing that, his Army made a great, shout, and cryed follow, follow, follow, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Boys, for we shall all be Conquerors. But the Lord <hi>Grace</hi> having recovered the intrenched Hill, with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> maintained the fight till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning by the break of day, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Signior Gracioso</hi> (with a heavenly Oration) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded his followers to a second incounter; which <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> no sooner heard, but with a fresh courage they led forth their Vangard, advancing their Banners after a most gallant manner, and made
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52888:76"/> a second and a sudden assault (the enemy being in their Tents) at the charge whereof, came thrice puisant <hi>Perseverance</hi> to their aid, with a mighty Host from the Lord <hi>Virtuoso:</hi> which Signior <hi>Gratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> perceiving, redoubled their courage, and cryed out aloud, <hi>Victory, Victory, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Enemy hearing this, in all post haste trussed up their trinkets, and in a disorderly order, as well as they could (upon such curtoll warning) defended themselves: but most worthy <hi>Perseverance</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, took the advantage, and so well <hi>behaved himself that day,</hi> that he made his foes to fly before his face: commanding <hi>Constancy</hi> with his couragious company, following close after that, methoughts in my Dream it rejoyced my heart to see it.</p>
               <p>Now Madam <hi>Cogitations</hi> seeing this, (ushered by her old servant <hi>Goodwill</hi>) secretly stole to her Castle: and meeting <hi>Lady Conscience</hi> at the Gate (in great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) craved her counsel how she might recover Lord <hi>Virtuoso</hi> his favour. Marry (quoth <hi>Conscience</hi>) you must go to <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Repentance:</hi> so disguising her self, that she might pass the better unknown, she met with <hi>Contrition,</hi> who with <hi>Repentance,</hi> brought her the next way to <hi>Humilitie</hi>'s Tent, which was placed at the foot of the hill fast by the intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whom <hi>Humility</hi> seeing afar off, made haste to meet, and very lovingly embraced and kissed them: <hi>Cogitations</hi> discovering all her intent, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her best aid in her sute to Lord <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> which she most willingly condescended unto, and went with her to the Generals Pavilion, and there with <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Contrition,</hi> falling down flat before his Excellency, confessed she had done amiss, and most earnestly and heartily craved pardon, which he most lovingly granting, lifted her up, set her on her feet before him, and most friendly communed with her.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52888:76"/>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Perseverance</hi> with <hi>Constancy</hi> so behaved themselves, that <hi>Don Vitioso</hi> with all his <hi>whole rout,</hi> was undone, and clean overthrown horse and foot: when (as the Devil would have it) in rusheth a mad rogue, one <hi>Stroy-good</hi> with a Chariot (for his Lord was so sore wounded that he could not ride) and speedily conveyed him by a secret way out of the field.</p>
               <p>In this overthrow were taken Prisoners, seven Captains of note, or notorious Captains, viz. <hi>Pride, Covetousness, Envy, Gluttony, Letchery, Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Sloth,</hi> (who as it appeared to me in my Dream, were those seven Enemies that so lately had sought my life) with a number of the Rascaldry besides. Some were ransomed, others were taken prisoners by the Enemy: others committed to perpetual imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and some (like <hi>Haman</hi>) were hanged for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others.</p>
               <p>There were also ordained seven special Officers for the good government of this noble Isle of Man, for prevention of future invasions: viz.</p>

               </list>
               <p>As they were in consultation about the future good of this <hi>little Common weal,</hi> and election of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers, a poor ragged Pilgrim that was travelling towards Jerusalem, <hi>all alone,</hi> seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>And being got upon my Leggs again, I saluted this Pilgrim very kindly,</hi> telling him withall, that I was very glad to find any Traveller, in that despised and narrow road I perceived he was going in: And I further told him, that seeing we were so happily met, that if he pleased, we would keep company together, and be helpful to each other in this our <hi>Pilgrimage.</hi> He answered and said readily, He wished with all his heart we might, <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>if either of us, after we have entred this path, and travelled so many miles herein, should look back and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the broad way that leads to hell, we shall make our selves for ever unfit for, and unworthy of the Celestial Paradice.</hi> After this Discourse was ended, I enquired particularly of him of what Country he was, he answered and said, He was born in the Wilderness below that hill upon which he found me asleep, that is called by some, <hi>(The false World)</hi> hearing of him say so, I told him that was a Country I knew very well: I was (said I) born in it my self, I dwelt in it many years, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there until Divine fury had overtaken me, and torn me to pieces, and tumbled me down into everlasting burnings, had not Divine Goodness war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me of my danger, and put it into my heart to go on pilgrimage as you now see. <hi>After this discourse was ended,</hi> we began hugely to embrace one another, and to love each other extreamly, and now it was nothing but <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> at every word, and now we really went forward with more speed and swiftness than before, and travelled so fast, that in a <hi>few dayes,</hi> we were got many hundred Miles from the brink of Destruction, towards our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And therefore now to this purpose I will tell tell you a pat story which I would have you keep in mind, till you come to the end of your journey. The story is this, There was a man had <hi>three Friends,</hi> two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he loved most intirely, the <hi>third</hi> he made no great account of. This man being sent for to come before his King, came and desired his <hi>first</hi> Friend to go with him, but he would not go with him, but brought him part of his way: he went to the <hi>second,</hi> and desired him to go with him, but he could not, but gave him something for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: he went unto the <hi>third,</hi> of whom he made no account or reckoning, and he went with him to the <hi>King and answered for him in all matters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>So poor Pilgrims</hi> in this world when they are sent for by <hi>Death,</hi> come to their Wives, Children, or Friends to go along with them into the <hi>unseen World,</hi> but they will not, but they go with them to their Graves. Then they desire their Goods and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to go along with them, but alas! they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, yet they can give them a Winding Sheet, Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin and decent <hi>Funeral.</hi> But their <hi>Consciences,</hi> oh! their <hi>Consciences,</hi> they will and they must go along with them, and answer for them before the Throne of the Great God of <hi>Heaven and Earth.</hi> Once more therefore, <hi>Dear Pilgrim,</hi> I intreat you have a great care th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ANd after I had eaten very plentifully here, and had <hi>satisfied nature,</hi> I sate me down (for a little time) and call'd for <hi>Pen Ink and Paper,</hi> and marked out, as well as I could, (as you may perceive by the following pages) <hi>the right and nearest way to Paradice,</hi> for the sake and help of all those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Pilgrims, that should for the future seek after this <hi>Heavenly Country</hi> I was still travelling to. <hi>In which pages moreover</hi> I likewise endeavour to give a faithful account of the chief wiles and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all Pilgrims must of necessity avoid, if ever they get safe thither.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>it must not be here expected</hi> that I should bring any thing <hi>that is new,</hi> for the way to <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> hath been allways the same since Christs <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summatum est,</hi> with whose Writings the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds; but because there is much difference in limitations and descriptions of Roads, I shall here apply my self to set forth some of them, and i'le set down nothing but what I my self have found by experience since I set out for <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

                  </gap>ence cannot properly be called <hi>Disobedience;</hi> and contrariwise the <hi>Paths</hi> of persons disposed to raise doubts, are always rugged and perplexed. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the way to Heaven is far from being <hi>level,</hi> yet it is not (as I have by sweet experience found) altogether <hi>unpleasant:</hi> and with resolved Travellers, Countrys consisting of <hi>Risings and Descents</hi> are esteemed the most delightful and refreshing.</p>
               <p>Your next <hi>remove</hi> is over the <hi>Mount of Justice,</hi> I mean not Justice in the largest acceptation, for so it is as comprehensive as <hi>Righteousness</hi> (or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible with it, containing a distribution of all that in any kind can be due, as obedience to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I take it as relating only to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and I give it an <hi>habitation</hi> upon a Hill, that it may have a <hi>fair and lovely Prospect:</hi> for no man can be just, but he must acquaint himself with <hi>circumstances,</hi> and the condition of him with whom he is to deal. The rule of Justice is to give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his due, and much more that which is his own in <hi>property.</hi> Within a <hi>stones throw</hi> of this <hi>Hill of Justice</hi> is easily to be seen in a clear day, (if the wary Pilgrim do but take a Prospective Glass) how that the <hi>four last Commandments</hi> of the ten save one, borders so far upon it, so as near half the <hi>Decalogue</hi> belongeth to it. And Justice is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in Christianity, as he who meriteth the name of a Just man, is understood to be a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly religious. A chief benefit arising from this vertue to those who are blessed with the habit of it, is freedom from the horror of <hi>Conscience,</hi> which is more frequently stirred up to disquiet by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, than by any other offence whatsoever, and this exemption is more precious, because a troubled Conscience is the greatest unhappiness that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall any man in this Life.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52888:83"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the foot of the Mount of Justice stands the House of Temperance,</hi> a frame built and situated rather for Conveniency than Curiosity, but wanting nothing that is useful for the entertainment of Pilgrims: here when I my self past by this place I found nothing of excess, and yet that which was convenient <hi>in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry respect.</hi> This Lady <hi>Temperance</hi> and her Family led a Life most contented, being not acquainted either with repining for want, or with extravagant desire of attaining more than they enjoy; their sleep is sweet, and they are not much in danger of Diseases, because most sickness arise from distempering and overclogging the Stomach. In this Family no good thing is forbidden, but the moderate use commanded. I find not in the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> either tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance litterally enjoyned, or the contrary forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but certainly it is greatly serviceable in the way to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> It preserves the faculties of the body and mind in their full strength as to all good duties, and therefore must be a very fit prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for <hi>Devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now it may be time for you to <hi>prosecute</hi> your journey beyond <hi>the House of Temperance,</hi> and therefore now when you have <hi>in a farewell salute</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leave both of Temperance and her <hi>two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sobriety and Chastity.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Having strengthened your selves at the <hi>Castle of Fortitude,</hi> you must descend into an obscure place, where there is <hi>a confluence of many Rivers, containing the waters of Affliction,</hi> upon these there is no <hi>Bridge,</hi> so as of force you must pass through them, and it is with much reluctation you will do it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within them, you will have occasion (if not necessity) of looking upwards towards Heaven, and of holding up your heads, lest you be overwhelmed. The <hi>cold</hi> of these waters hath such operation, as it driveth the heat inwards, making you to reflect upon your selves, and your former miscarriages. I speak only of those, who are furnished with grace sufficient to support them, for others there are, who being voluptuously disposed, make no resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but are carried away with the stream, and utterly leave the <hi>path of Holiness,</hi> giving themselves wholly to be governed b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But those who are better disposed, use all their strength to recover the passage, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the right tract, and these are the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be directed. These are not fully recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of damage by those waters, or at least the damage is not forgotten by them, when they pass
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52888:84"/> near to the <hi>bathing place of Repentance,</hi> and if they will, they may forbear to use the <hi>bathing;</hi> but their <hi>good Angel</hi> calleth upon them to purge themselves, telling them that their way having been narrow, they have made <hi>wandrings,</hi> so as it is very needful for them to be purged by Sorrow, for their deviations, and from the filth contracted thereby: and certainly <hi>Repentance</hi> is necessary in the way to Salvation. For can that Faith be true, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to an assurance of sins to be forgiven, which were never either generally or particularly repented of, or remission implored for them? From these waters by an <hi>ascent</hi> you will go (though with difficulty) by reason of your fainting Spirits, to the <hi>Garden of spiritual Consolation,</hi> a place not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasing, but useful: <hi>For there we may discern at a considerable distance, the Rock of Faith and the Temple of Holiness, as also the way to them.</hi> And in that <hi>Garden</hi> may be gathered the <hi>herb of Grace</hi> use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Nutrition and Sustentation, and <hi>Salvia</hi> (or the hope of Salvation) as an incentive to Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, from both which you may receive fresh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, enabling you to undergo the residue of your journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now leaving the Garden of Comfort,</hi> you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the vale of <hi>Humility.</hi> This was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown to the Heathen, or at least not esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Virtue, which they alwayes placed in activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and took this for a hindrance to it. I find it mentioned in the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but the <hi>Jews</hi> put it little in practice; so as we may term it purely Christian, especially that part of it which consisteth in relation only between man and man. <hi>This Valley is so invironed with tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hills, as it is altogether free from the tempestuous blasts of Ambition, and the Inhabitants are happy in the enjoyment of the blessings arising from peace and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52888:84"/> quiet; for here comes no</hi> Promethean <hi>Eagle of Care feeding upon the heart,</hi> no ravenous Wolf of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, no circumventing Fox, nor undermining Cony of humane Policy. All is peaceable, no noise of Complaint or Grief, their Musick being that of the <hi>innocent Turtle</hi> and the <hi>early Lark,</hi> the <hi>wakeful Nightingale,</hi> and such like. But before you leave this <hi>valley of Humility,</hi> you must come to the Fountain, or <hi>Well-spring of Charity,</hi> which is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible, receiving its virtue and plenty from a Charity, of as much higher nature, as its habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is higher, even Heaven it self. Out of this <hi>Well-spring of Charity,</hi> continually floweth water composing the <hi>River of Beneficence,</hi> or good works, which divideth it self into many streams, that it may the better water and refresh those dry and thirsty grounds which need it. Lastly, I must give notice, that every Christian Traveller in this <hi>via lactea,</hi> or <hi>milky way to heaven,</hi> must drink very deep in the well of Charity, for he cannot have admittance to Paradice without doing so, there being no place for envy, Rancour or Malice, and such like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whereas Charity which is the cement of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly society, and bond of Perfection, hath clear and uncontrouled entrance there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now having passed the Well-spring of Charity, you must leave the vale of Humility, and come to the rock of Faith.</hi> A Rock I may well call it, for our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Saviour</hi> doth so, when <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.18. he saith to St. <hi>Peter, upon this Rock will I build my church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Rock is high and hard of ascent;</hi> but you may help your selves in getting up, by the <hi>Scala sancta,</hi> or <hi>holy Stair of hope,</hi> and not improperly, since by St. <hi>Paul</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>Faith</hi> is defined to be the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of things hoped for.</hi> But of what faith is this Book composed? Certainly not of that Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Devils are capable, who are said to believe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52888:85"/> and tremble. Therefore it must be that Faith which we call Justifying or Saving Faith.</p>
               <p>But here I must not forbear to express, that from <hi>the height of this Rock of Faith,</hi> a good Christian may in a fair day see (as <hi>Moses</hi> did the promised Land from Mount <hi>Nebo) as much of Paradise,</hi> as is needful, to comfort him against afflictions, and to arm him against the <hi>terrours of death,</hi> whose gulf must be passed before admittance into Paradise; but of that more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now I have thus chalked out the right way to Paradise, it will be needful to represent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of straying, for good Pilgrims have those at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending constantly upon them, who will not fail at <hi>every stage</hi> by <hi>Entisement or Terrour</hi> to mislead them. These are the <hi>World, the Flesh, and the Devil,</hi> all of them sworn enemies to Mankind, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing friendship. First, <hi>In the plain of Obedience,</hi> on the right hand, the <hi>World</hi> putteth <hi>Passengers</hi> in mind that Obedience is no way at all to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and honour. <hi>And on the left hand,</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> crieth up Liberty, and brandeth Obedience with the unpleasing name of <hi>Servitude. Ʋpon the mount of Justice, on this hand,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> representeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by gifts, with the favour of great Persons to be obtained; <hi>and on that hand,</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> suggesteth great trouble and care in keeping the balance even, with danger by loss of Friends and favour; <hi>and in the way of Justice,</hi> in private dealings damage to our selves, by parting with that which we might hold. <hi>At the house of Temperance</hi> they lay several baits, and some terrour to keep us from entring in. <hi>To the young person the Flesh presents Beauty, tempting him to Incontinence, telling him that Youth will not last ever, and that it is folly to lose the pleasures of it.</hi> The <hi>aged</hi> person's Sobriety is assaulted by offers of Wine or strong drink, and he is told, that the uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52888:85"/> of his great years, is to be qualified by that which may render them chearful. And all ages are tempted by them with excess in Diet, and they all cry out with St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epicurean, 1 Cor. 15.32. <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. As for Christian Fortitude,</hi> they have several batteries against it. First, <hi>the Flesh</hi> represents the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of Shame and Ignominy, <hi>then</hi> the terrours of Death: And <hi>lastly,</hi> the Devil affirms it the height of Folly, to suffer for Truth, which is strong and will prevail howsoever; and as for Rewards after this life, he cries them down as no ways to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. <hi>In the waters of Affliction</hi> the Devil hath one great artifice, which is by suggesting to the person that he is out of Gods favour irrecoverably, nay, in high displeasure with him; and therefore <hi>(like Job's Wife)</hi> he provokes him to curse God, and to apply himself to other remedies, wherein <hi>the World and the Flesh tender their assistance, as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds. At the baths of Repentance,</hi> the Devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends godly sorrow to be useless, upon the same grounds newly delivered at the waters of Affliction, and that there is great want of Wisdom in those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who wilfully render their lives unpleasant by grief, and by a refusal of those pleasures which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to them. And in case he prevail not in preventing Repentance, then he seeks to keep them from entring <hi>into the garden of Consolation,</hi> by aggravating unto them all their past offenees, affirming that there is no hope of mercy, and by seeking to prove it by Scripture, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The soul that sinneth it shall die;</hi> and <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.27. <hi>Every man shall be rewarded according to his works,</hi> but still concealing those Texts that unfold the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God. <hi>In the vale of Humility,</hi> the Devil set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth how all men are of the same extraction from <hi>Adam,</hi> and that the meanest may have as good
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52888:86"/> natural parts as the highest. That since <hi>honours and riches</hi> are in the world, that man who affecteth Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility may and ought to have his part in them, as well as others. <hi>That an humble conceit</hi> of a man's self and his own parts, causeth others to conceive <hi>meanly</hi> of him, and that this keeps him under, so as he should do well to lift up his head, and forsake <hi>Humility,</hi> which is so disadvantageous to him. But the chief strivings of that infernal Spirit, are <hi>at the well-spring of Charity and river of Beneficence, Charity.</hi> being a vertue most opposite to his nature; but here again he will tell you, that Charity is opposite to all the ways of Eminency in this world, and that <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>greatness</hi> are attained by supplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and Riches by imposing upon other mens weakness. And lastly, he expresseth the <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Revenge,</hi> which is perfectly opposite to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As for the <hi>Rock of Faith,</hi> the Devil now of late endeavoureth to blow it up wholly by Heresie and Errour.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to expess some of the chief dangers offering themselves in the way to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, that those Christian Pilgrims who are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned may be fore-armed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now at present</hi> i'le insist no longer upon these instructions for fear I should be too tedious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but proceed to give you an account of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of my Pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well then thus it was,</hi> after I had left this <hi>Inn</hi> that lay on the Boad where I called for refreshment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I travelled again towards <hi>Jerusalem</hi> as nimbly as if I had been inspired, but far I did not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I found three Country Boobees, whose names were <hi>Folly, Lazibones,</hi> and <hi>Presumption</hi> fast asleep with Iron Fetters upon their Legs, but rousing them, I bid them have a care lest the Roaring Devils should find them and make them his prey. But
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52888:86"/> seeming not to regard me; <hi>The first said, I see no danger, the second, yet a little sleep; the third let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Tub <hi>stand upon his own</hi> Bottom; So that I seeing there was no good to be done, I went away and left them to sleep on. Then going a little farther I met <hi>Dissimulation</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> who would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me to go with them, but I refused it and passed on. Now when I was rid of them I went up a mountain called <hi>Difficulty</hi> and with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour attained the middle of it, where finding a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant House I went in, and pulled out my Bible to read, and whilst I read I fell asleep; but being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by a heavenly voice, I started up, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bible fall went away without it to the top of the Hill, where I met one <hi>Fearful</hi> and one <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief</hi> running back from the place they were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling too as hard as they could drive. When I demanded what was the cause, they told me they had been travelling to Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> but in the way stood two Robbers, and that they durst not go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farther, and likewise advised me to go back, but I refused. Then feeling for my Bible I found I had lost it, which much perplexed me, so that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go back to the Arbour where I slept, and being come thither I found it to my unspeakable joy; for had I lost it my journey had been made in vain; then pressing forward in a narrow path I saw two Lyons and was afraid, so that I had gone back had not a voice called to me and bid me keep the middle way, for the Lyons were chained and could not hurt me. Then I walked on and came to a <hi>stately Palace</hi> called <hi>Delightful,</hi> built by the Lord of the <hi>Celestial City.</hi> Here I lodged for two nights with <hi>Discretion, Prudence, Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> who shewed me many strange things, and to whom I related my adventures, who gave me a suit of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and led me through the Valley of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:52888:87"/> where they left me. So the next place I entred was the <hi>Valley of the shadow of Death.</hi> Now when I came to the border of it and beheld many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful shapes in it, I stood in doubt whether I had best enter or not. But I finding it was my way to the <hi>Holy City,</hi> I presently slighted all dangers, and was resolved to venture with my Pilgrims staff in my hand: so in I went, where I saw many dreadful things, as Satyrs, Ghosts and Hell it self flashing cut flames of fire, and Spirits rushing to and fro; then I began to be afraid and cryed out, <hi>O Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee deliver my Soul,</hi> Psal. 1.16. but going on I heard some one before me say, <hi>Though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of Death I will fear none ill, for thou art with me,</hi> Psal. 33.4. then began I to take courage, as knowing some others besides my self were on the way; So I travelled through a thousand dangers till I came to the end of the Valley, and then the Sun arose; and so I looking back I espied the perils I had escaped, and greatly rejoyced, saying, <hi>His candle shines upon my head, and by his light I travel through darkness,</hi> Job 29.3. Now after I had passed this danger I espied a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and being desirous of Company I hasted after him, and found him to be one <hi>Trueheart</hi> who came from the same Country I came from and was there my Neighbour, upon which account we rejoyced greatly in each others Company, resolving not to part; for as the wse man saith, two are better than one. So on we went talking of the several adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we had met with in the way, and how we had escaped them. At last as we went talking along we met with a very aged man who told us his name was <hi>Adam,</hi> and first he inquired where we were going and we told him to Paradice. Then, said he, it will be better to come and live with me, and your lives shall be very delightful, and for our wages he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52888:87"/> would leave me sole inheritor of his possessions; and further he told us that he had three beautiful Daughters whose names were <hi>Pride, Fleshly Lust,</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> and that we should marry one or all of them. But we not liking him, knowing that if we went along with him he would make a bondslave of us, we turned away from him, at which he seemed very angry, and menaced us with grievous threats; and not so contented but he took hold of our flesh, and pulled so hard that we thought he had taken some pieces out: but turning to look him we saw this Inscription in his Forehead <hi>(Put off the old man with his Deeds)</hi> then we knew who he was.</p>
               <p>Now we had no sooner escaped him but one <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologus</hi> overtook us whom formerly we had received excellent instructions from, saying, peace be with you whom I intirely love. When we saw him we greatly rejoyced and welcomed him a thousand times, telling him all the snares we had escaped by taking his counsel.</p>
               <p>Then he laid before us all the glory that await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in the <hi>Celestial City</hi> if we persevered to the end. But said he, you will still meet with many trials in the way, therefore be faithful unto death and you will receive a Crown of Life. For, said he, you are still to go through a large Country call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Prophaness,</hi> where is a great Market kept all the year, where all sorts of <hi>Vanities</hi> are made merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of; here you will be hard put to it and find many enemies, and if you refuse to comply with their Vanities they will put you to death, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever lays down his life for the King of the <hi>Celestial City</hi> shall find life eternal; therefore by no means give heed to what they say, <hi>for he who is put to death there will take the nearest way to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:52888:88"/>
               <p>Then he left us, whereupon passing through a large Chace we entred into this Market, which it seems was established by the <hi>Prince of Darkness</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two thousand years since. The chief mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice that is sold there is Vanities of all sorts, as <hi>Whores, Bauds, Houses, Trades, Lusts, Pleasures, Stately-preferments, Wives, Husbands, Children, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Servants, Gold, Silver, Gems, Lives, Souls, Blood, and what not.</hi> Now when we were in the Market, we not only refused to buy these Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices but slighted them, saying, we bought the Truth and not Trash, which so inraged some of the Rabble that they fell upon us and halled us before the Judge as contemners and disturbers of their Market, who committed us to the Common Prison, where we were derided and scoffed at, yet some good men of the Country were we where took our parts, but had e'ne as good have held their tongues, for they were abused for so doing. The next day we were brought to our Trials, where <hi>Superstition, Pick-thank</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> swore against us, that we had spoken against the Lord of the Market, and strove to draw away his Subjects and all the Nobility that are his Kindred, as <hi>Carnal Delight,</hi> the <hi>Old Man,</hi> the Lord <hi>Desire of vain Glory,</hi> the Lord <hi>Luxurious,</hi> Lord <hi>Lechery</hi> and several others, nor have they, said the witnesses, refrained to asperse your Lordship. To all this my Brother <hi>True Heart</hi> made answer, since <hi>Belzebub</hi> was Lord of the Market, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an enemy to the King of the <hi>Celestial City,</hi> he did defie him and all that appertained to him, for his portion he had was not in this life, but in the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> to which he was travelling. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Jury having received their charge, grounded upon certain Statutes made in the time of <hi>Nebuchadnezar, Darius</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> brought him in guilty, so that he was delivered to the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52888:88"/> who after they had scourged him, slashed him with knives, and barbarously abused him, they burnt him to ashes: Now as he expired in the flames I beheld several <hi>Angels descend and fetch his soul into the aboads of bliss, sounding before him with loud Trumpets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whilst they were in this hurry in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I like a resolved Pilgrim, through the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Divine Providence, made my escape out of prison, and got out of the Country of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanness;</hi> so I went on again pondering upon my strange adventures, till I came to a style that led into a pleasant meadow, when finding the high way rough, I left it, and went over this style: but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great way, after I was over, I found I was mistaken in my way, and therefore was resolved to return. But then the storms arose, and night coming on I could not find the way, but lying down under a little shelter, where falling asleep, a grim fellow next morning carried me to a <hi>dismal Dungeon,</hi> called <hi>Disbelief,</hi> where he beat me very grievously for about seven weeks time, but at last I opened the gates with a key called <hi>Promise,</hi> and got thence, making what haste I could to the right road, which led me to a delectable Prospect, called <hi>Contemplation,</hi> where I once again, to the joy of my heart, got a fresh sight of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and there I stayed and refreshed my self, and took new directions of the Towns-men that dwelt there, and then departed; but was again after this led out of the way by the <hi>Flatterer,</hi> and taken in a net, and there had certainly perished, had not one of the <hi>Celestial guard</hi> come by and delivered me, who, after he had given the flatterer correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, set me in the right way. So on again I went rejoycing, but I did not go far before I met with a man called <hi>Atheist,</hi> who had turned his back upon <hi>Zi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi> and who would have perswaded me to have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52888:89"/> done the like. But I minded him not, but kept still travelling on, having the Glory of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> still in my eye, and (for ever be adored the riches of Divine Grace;) so it fell out that through abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Vicissitudes and Changes, I came at last to a <hi>narrow River,</hi> which parted the <hi>Wilderness</hi> of this World, and the Heavenly <hi>Paradise,</hi> through which I was compelled to pass, in regard there was no other <hi>way</hi> to the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> but that. Now this <hi>River</hi> through which I was to pass, was called by the name of <hi>Death,</hi> I was extreamly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful when I first saw the <hi>River,</hi> and began to quake with Trembling, and wished that the going through that <hi>River,</hi> had not been the road to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at last considering with my self, that there was no <hi>other road,</hi> and that he was unworthy of a Crown, that would not couragiously adventure through a thousand difficulties to win it, I pluck'd up my <hi>fainting Spirits,</hi> and called aloud to my three old Friends, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> (seeing that formerly they had been so kind to me in my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and upon all <hi>emergent occasions</hi> had promised to help me) and begg'd of them most earnestly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my <hi>bended knees,</hi> that they would assist me now in my <hi>last moments,</hi> and bear me company, through the River, or else I was undone for ever, and should even at the last (though I had travelled so very nigh towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and overcome so many dangers to get there) miss of ever arriving to that <hi>happy region.</hi> These three, though formerly my <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>very dear</hi> Friends, and the only persons that were ready to relieve me under my <hi>Troubles,</hi> at my first call returned no answer, (and which was worse) seem'd not to listen at all, which on a sudden put me to a great plunge but <hi>Conscience,</hi> (thanks be to Almighty God) sweetly smiling upon me, which is the best

               <p>IN this <hi>Passing-Bell</hi> you may see the wicked man, though his <hi>Intrat</hi> may be Comical, his <hi>Exit</hi> is alway Tragical. <hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s first Scene is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling out his time in sin and pleasure, feasting and carousing with his Concubines in the Vessels of the Lord; but view him in the Catastrophe, and you shall find the hand-writing, and him trembling, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> rending away his Kingdom, and Death snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his Life. If you look upon the entrance of a wicked man, his Gates are Riches, his Seats Honours, his Paths Pleasures; he goes Delicately, fares Deliciously every day, he hath more than heart
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52888:94"/> can wish: but wait his going out and see a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, in a moment one Disease or other throws him on a sick bed, and from thence he goes down quick to Hell. The man is cast out from God as an everlasting curse: destruction closes her mouth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and now the Eye that hath seen him shall see him no more: his body is wrapt in the dust, his soul is buried in the flames, and his name is covered with darkness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But possibly as soon as ever sickness seizeth on him, and he verily believing he shall dye, he may immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately send for the Minister, (tho he never car'd to come near him before) and other Christian Friends to pray for him and with him, and likewise may desire Bills to be put up in the Church in behalf of his poor soul.</hi>

               <p>WE have an ingenious Author, who writ a <hi>Discourse of Bells,</hi> when he was Prisoner in <hi>Turkie.</hi> How would he have inlarged himself, if he had been my fellow-prisoner in this <hi>sick-bed,</hi> so near to that <hi>Steeple,</hi> which never ceases, no more than the <hi>harmony of the Spheres,</hi> but is more heard. When the <hi>Turks</hi> took <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they melted the <hi>Bells</hi> into <hi>Ordnance;</hi> I have heard both <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Ordnance,</hi> but never been so much affected with those, as with these <hi>Bells.</hi> I have lain near a <hi>Steeple,</hi> by which there are said to be more than <hi>thirty Bells;</hi> and ne're another, where there is one so big, as

Here the <hi>Bells</hi> can scarce solemnize the Funeral of any person, but that I knew him, or knew that he was my Neighbour: we dwelt in Houses near to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, but now he is gone into that House, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I must follow him. There is a way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Children of great Persons, that other Children are corrected in their behalf, and in their names, and this works upon them, who indeed had more deserved it. And when these <hi>Bells</hi> tell me, that now one, and now another is buried, must not I acknowledge, that they have the Correction due t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me, and paid the Debt that I owe? There is a story of a <hi>Bell</hi> in a <hi>Monastery,</hi> which, when any of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It rung once, when no man was sick, but the next day one of the House fell from the <hi>Steeple</hi> and died, and the <hi>Bell</hi> held the reputation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet still. If these <hi>Bells</hi> that warn to a <hi>Funeral</hi> now, were appropriated to none, may not I, by the hour of the <hi>Funeral</hi> supply? How many men that stand at an <hi>Execution,</hi> if they would ask, for what dies that man, should hear their own faults condemned, and see themselves executed, by <hi>Atturney?</hi> We scarce hear of any <hi>preferred,</hi> but we think our selves, that we might very well have been that man, that is carried to his <hi>Grave</hi> now?

                  </gap>s than I, but I was born to as many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as they. To be an Incumbent by lying down in a Grave, to be a Doctor by teaching Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Example, by dying, though I may have Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52888:96"/> others may be elder than I, yet I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded apace in a good <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> and gone a great way in a little time, by the furtherance of a vehement <hi>Fever,</hi> and whomsoever these <hi>Bells</hi> bring to the ground to day, if he and I had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared yesterday, perchance I should have been thought likelier to have come to this preferment then, than he. God hath kept the power of Death in his own hands, lest any man should bribe death. If man knew the gain of death, the ease of death, he would provoke Death to assist him, by any hand which he might use. But as men see many of their own Professions preferred, it ministers a hope that may be light upon them; so when these hourly <hi>Bells</hi> tell me of so many <hi>Funerals</hi> of men, like me, it presents, if not a desire that it may, yet a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort whensoever mine shall come.</p>
               <p>But he for whose Funeral these <hi>Bells</hi> ring now, was at home, at his journeys end, yesterday; why ring they now? A man, that is a world, is all the things in the world; He is an Armie, and when an Army marches, the Van may lodge to night, where the Rear comes not till to morrow. A man extends to his act, and to his example; to that which he does, and that which he teaches, so do those things that concern him, so do these <hi>Bells;</hi> that which rung yesterday was to convey him out of the world, in his Vant, in his soul, that which rung to day, was to bring him in his Rear, in his body, to the Church; and this continuing of ringing after his entring, is to bring him to me in the Application. Where I lie I could hear the Psalm, and did joyn with the Congregation in it; but I could not hear the Sermon, and these later <hi>Bells</hi> are a repetition Sermon to me. But O my God, my God, do I that have this <hi>Fever,</hi> need other remembrances of my mortality? Is not mine own hollow voice, voice enough to pronounce
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52888:97"/> that to me? Need I look upon a Deaths Head in a Ring, that have one in my Face, or go for Death to my Neighbours house, that have him in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som?</p>

And perchance I may think my self so much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that. The <hi>Church is Catholick Ʋniversal,</hi> so are all her actions; all that she does, belongs to all.</p>
               <p>When she baptizes a child, that action concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that Head, which is my Head too, and ingraffed into that Body, whereof I am a member. And when she buries a man, that action concerns me.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And now Reader is it not, think you, a great folly, that men are so unwilling to think of death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! questionless it is: for we see the Marriner, with joy, thinks of the Haven. The Labourer is glad to see the Evening. The Traveller is merry when his journey is ended. The Souldier is not sorry, when his fight is over: and shall we be grieved when the days of sin are ended by Death.</p>
               <p>And now in a word, all mankind is of one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the Book, but translated into a better Language; and every chapter must be so translated; God imploys several Translators; some pieces are translated by Age, some by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, some by Justice, but Gods hand is in every translation; and his hand shall bind up all our scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered leaves again, for that Library where every Book shall lye open to one another: As therefore the <hi>Bell</hi> that rings to a Sermon, calls not upon the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52888:99"/> Preacher only, but upon the Congregation to come; so this <hi>Bell</hi> calls us all: but how much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sudden sickness.</p>
               <p>But the truth on it is the <hi>Bell</hi> doth toll for him, that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again yet from that minute, that that occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. Who casts not up his Eye to the Sun when it rises? But who takes off his Eye from a Comet, when that breaks out? who bends not his Ear to any <hi>Bell,</hi> which upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion rings? But who can remove it from that <hi>Bell,</hi> which is passing a piece of himself out of this world? No man is an <hi>Island,</hi> intire of it self; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the Main; if a Clod be washed away by the Sea, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> is the less, as well as if a Promontary were, as well as if a Mannor of thy Friends or of thine own were; Any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the <hi>Bell</hi> tolls; <hi>it tolls for thee.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we call this a begging of misery, or a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of our selves, but must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the misery of our Neighbours. Truly it were an excuseable cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, if we did; for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath enough of it. No man hath Affliction enough, that is not matured, and ripened by it, and made fit for God by that Affliction. If a man carry treasure in <hi>Bullion,</hi> or in a <hi>Wedge of Gold,</hi> and have none coyned into <hi>currant Monys,</hi> his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure will not defray him as he travels. Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our home, Heaven, by it. Another may be sick too, and sick to <hi>Death,</hi> and this Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52888:99"/> may lye in his bowels, as Gold in a Mine, and be of no use to him; but this <hi>Bell</hi> that tells me of his Affliction, digs out, and applyes that Gold to me: If by this consideration of anothers dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I take mine own into contemplation, and so secure my self, by making my recourse to my God, who is our onely security.</p>

                     <hi>O</hi> Eternal and most gracious God, I have a new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of thanks, and a new occasion of Prayer to thee from the ringing of this <hi>Bell.</hi> Thou toldst me in the other voice, that I was mortal, and approaching to death; in this I may hear thee say, that I am dead, in an irremediable, in an irrecoverable state for bodily health. If that be thy language in this voyce, how infinitely am I bound to thy heavenly Majesty, for speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so plainly unto me? for even that voice, that I must dye now, is not the voice of a Judge, that speaks by way of condemnation, but of a Physician, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents health in that: Thou presentest me <hi>Death</hi> as the cure of my disease, not as the exaltation of it; if I mistake thy voice herein, if <hi>I</hi> overrun thy pace, and prevent thy hand, and imagine death more instant upon me than thou hast bid him be, yet the voice belongs to me; <hi>I</hi> am dead, <hi>I</hi> was born dead, and from the first laying of these mud walls in my conception, they have moldred away, and the whole course of life is but an active death. Whether this voice instruct me, that <hi>I</hi> am dead man now, or remember me, that <hi>I</hi> have been a dead man all this while, <hi>I</hi> humbly thank thee for speaking in this voice to my soul.</p>

                  <p>MY God, my God, is this one of thy ways, of drawing light out of darkness, to make him for whom this <hi>Bell</hi> tolls, now in this dimness of his sight, to become a Superintendent, an Overseer, a Bishop, to as many as hear his voice, in this <hi>Bell,</hi> and to give us a confirmation in this action? Is this one of thy ways to raise strength out of Weakness, to make him who cannot rise from his bed, nor stir in his bed, come home to me, and in this sound give me the strength of healthy and vigorous Instructions? O my God, my God, what thunder is not a well-tuned Cymbal, what hoarseness, what harshness is not a clear Organ, if thou be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to set thy voice to it? and what Organ is not well played on, if thy hand be upon it? Thy voice, thy hand is in this sound, and in this one sound, I hear this whole consort. I hear thy <hi>Jacob</hi> call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Sons, and say, <hi>Gather your selves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days,</hi> Gen 49.1. he sayes, <hi>That which I am now, you must be then.</hi> I hear thy <hi>Moses</hi> telling me, and all within the compass of this sound, <hi>This is the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing wherewith I bless you before my death,</hi> Deut. 33.1. This, that before your death you would consider your own in mine. I hear thy Prophet saying to <hi>Ezechias, Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live;</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.1. He makes us of his Family, and calls this a setting of his house in order, to compose us to the <hi>meditation of death.</hi> I hear thy Apostles saying, <hi>I think it meet to put you in remembrance, knowing that shortly I must go out of this Tabernacle,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. This is the publishing of his will, and this <hi>Bell</hi> is our Legacy, the supplying of his present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to our use.</p>

                  <hi>MEDITATION V.</hi> The Bell rings out, and tells me in him, that I am dead.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Bell</hi> rings out, the Pulse thereof is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the tolling was a faint, and intermitting Pulse, upon one side; this stronger, and argues more and better life. His soul is gone out; and as a man who had a lease of 1000 years after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of a short one, or an Inheritance after the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52888:101"/> life of a man, in a Consumption, he is now entred into the possession of his better estate. His Soul is gone; whither? Who saw it come in, or who saw it go out? No body, yet every body is sure, he had one, and hath none. If I will ask, not a few men, but almost whole bodies, whole Churches, how the Souls of men at their departing from the body go out, I shall be told, they cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> studied the nature of the Soul, as much as any thing, but the salvation of the Soul, as and he sent an express Messenger to Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> to consult of some things concerning the Soul: but he satisfies himself with this: <hi>Let the departure of my soul to salvation, be evident to my faith, and I care the less, how dark the entrance of my soul into my body, be to my reason.</hi> It is the well going out, more than the coming in, that concerns us. This soul, this <hi>bell</hi> tells me, is gone out, whither? Who shall tell me that? I know not who it is, much less what he was; the condition of the man, and the course of his life, which would tell me whither he is gone, I know not. I was not there in his sickness, nor at <hi>his death;</hi> I saw not his way, nor his end, nor can ask them, who did, thereby to conclude or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue whither he is gone. But yet I have one nearer me then all these, mine own <hi>Charity;</hi> I ask that, and that tells me, <hi>he is gone to everlasting rest,</hi> and joy and glory: I owe him a good opinion, it is but thankful Charity in me, because I received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and instruction from him when his <hi>Bell</hi> tolled: and I do verily believe that his soul is gone to everlasting rest, and joy and glory. But for the Body, how poor a wretched thing is that? we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not express it so fast, as it grows worse and worse. That Body, which scarce three minutes since was such a house, as that that soul, which made but one step from thence to heaven, was scarce throughly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52888:101"/> content to leave that for heaven: that body hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost the name of a dwelling house, because none dwells in it, and is making haste to lose the name of a Body, and dissolve to putrifaction. Who would not be affected to see a clear and sweet Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the morning, grow a Kennel of muddy Land water by noon, and condemned to the saltness of the Sea by night? and how lame a Picture, how faint a Representation is that, of the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mans body to dissolution? now all the parts built up, and knit by a lovely soul, now but a statue of Clay, and now these limbs melted off, as if that Clay were but Snow; and now the whole house is but a handful of Sand, so much Dust, and but a peck of Rubbidge, so much Bone.

                  <p>However my heart <hi>thus poured out,</hi> was not spilt on the ground. My Prayers too late to do him good, came soon enough to speak my good will, what I freely tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God freely took, according to the integrity of my Intentions.

But if God had now denied this favour unto me, he should have dealt with me but according to justice; I have lived a good time in this parish, I have been invited by my friends, called by the bell, moved by the good report I heard of you and others, to come to this Church: but I made many excuses, as of sickness, and going to other places, and did not come. And though I have many sins which I must answer for, yet none at this time grieveth me more, than that I have lived under a painful ministery, and yet was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partaker of it: so that you and the whole parish may judge, that I am either of no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or of a contrary religion to that which is professed in this kingdom: pray for me that this my sin may be pardoned: hear me make a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my faith, and that I dye in the faith of Christ, and am heartily sorry for this mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: I pray you therefore make it known when I am dead and gone.</q>

                     <p>And now here I will a little descant upon these <hi>three great and valiant Conquerours,</hi> who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at last had their <hi>Passing-bell</hi> rung in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest by <hi>Deaths</hi> impartial Darts.</p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52888:113"/>
                     <p>And in the first place, <hi>How remarkable is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> of <hi>Diogenes</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> What art thou mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on, <hi>Cynick,</hi> says this <hi>Monarch</hi> to him one day, having found him in a <hi>Charnel-yard,</hi> I amuse my self here (answers he) in search of thy Father <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s bones among this great number, which thou seest; but my labour is in vain, <hi>one differs not from another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now therefore, O great <hi>Alexander,</hi> what a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid spectacle is this, what a frightful object? See you not this great number of <hi>Dead mens sculls,</hi> which heaped one upon another, make a mountain of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and affrightment, whose baleful, and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous umbrage, insensibly invites our bodies on to the grave. What a victory is <hi>this</hi> over <hi>these?</hi> but what an <hi>inhumanity?</hi> what a <hi>defeat?</hi> but what a <hi>butchery?</hi> May we not say, that <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>rage,</hi> have assassinated, even Natures-self, and that you and I do as it were now remain alive in the world, to celebrate its funerals by our lamentations, and regrets. <hi>Fathers, Mothers, Children, Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Plebeians, Kings,</hi> and their <hi>subjects</hi> are all pell-mell in this stack of rotten wood, which Time like a covert, but burning fire consumes by little and little, and not able to suffer, that <hi>ashes</hi> should be exalted above <hi>dust.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Great Kings,</hi> the discuss of this answer, may serve you now as a fresh instruction, to insinuate to you the knowledge of your selves. You walk in triumph to the Tomb, followed with all the train of your ordinary magnificences: but by being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at this Port, blown thither with the continual gale of your sighs, your <hi>pomp</hi> vanisheth away, your <hi>Royal Majesty</hi> abandons you, your greatness gives you the <hi>last Adieu,</hi> and this your mortal fall <hi>equals you now,</hi> to all that were below you before.</p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:52888:113"/>
                     <p>But if you doubt of this truth,<note place="margin">Corruptio optimi pessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and contemplate the sculls of those Emperours and Nobles that are now in their Tombs. Their <hi>bald scalps</hi> have now no other <hi>Crown,</hi> then the <hi>circle of horrour,</hi> which invirons them; their disincarnated hands hold now no other Scepter but a pile of worms, and all the glories of their Court, now lie in the dust.</p>
                     <p>And now here methinks, what a Prodigy of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is here! do I not see, the great Army of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> reduced and metamorphosed into a handful of dust? All that world of men in those days, which with its umbragious body covered a great part of the earth, shades not so much as a foot of it with its presence. Oh! be never weary of thinking of these important truths.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> in the Tragedy of <hi>Hercules</hi> brings in <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> with grievous lamentation, bearing in an urn, the ashes of that great <hi>Monster-Tamer;</hi> and to this effect makes her speak: <hi>Behold, how easily I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him in my hand, who bore the heavens upon his shoulders.</hi> The sense of these words, ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all truly noble spirits to a deep meditation upon the vanity of things below, which seem most du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. All those great Monarchs who sought an immortality in their victories and triumphs, have mist that, and found death at last, the enjoyment of their Crowns and splendours, being buried in the same Tomb with their bodies.</p>
                     <p>Nay further, Death is so uncomely as to seize even beautiful Ladies with his clammy hands, and so occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the <hi>Passing-bell</hi> to toll for them too. <hi>The first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph</hi> which was put upon Tombs, was that of the <hi>fair Rachel,</hi> as is partly remarkt from S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                           <pb n="182" facs="tcp:52888:114"/>Here lyes fair <hi>RACHEL</hi> composed of nothing but BEAƲTY and LOVE.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ladies let your sweetness and blandishments now change language, and let them tell us no more that you are fair, since <hi>Beauty</hi> is buried in the Tomb of the fair <hi>Rachel:</hi> But if you make Bravado of your crisped hairs, whose glistering charms dazle the eyes, and captivate mens souls at once: Her bright locks dispersed into a thousand golden wreaths, had the power to enchain mens hearts, and yet her vertue was to despise this power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death rung her <hi>Passing-bell.</hi> But for all this, notwithstanding Nature was never able to exempt from rottenness this Mistris, or Master-piece of the works of her hands. Suppose that Majesty it self, has no better Mirrour than from the clear reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your ivory fore-heads: <hi>Rachel's</hi> was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that it is in vain to seek terms to express its accurateness, and yet now it is nothing but ashes, if so much.</p>
                     <p>Let your Eyes (suppose) be more clear and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than the Sun, able to make a rape upon mens liberties, and enamourate the sternest hearts; those of <hi>Rachel</hi> were so admirable and bewitching, that she her self redoubted their force and power. Looking her self in a Mirrour, her own eyes enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her, and of this pleasing heat, she apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the influence, being her self even tempted to desire it: But for all this, those two sparkling won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, quickned with Natures sweetest, and most amiable graces, are now nothing but rottenness and corruption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Be your Cheeks half Lillies half Roses,</hi> your lips Carnation-Gilly-flowers, your teeth Orient Pearl, your bosom purest Alabaster, and all these lovely
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52888:114"/> parts enlivened with a spirit divine: fair <hi>Rachel</hi> possest all these perfections soveraignly, and more than ever you saw or wisht, as elevated above your knowledge. But (O mishap) she her self, in whom all these rare beauties were united and assembled, is now nothing at all; or if she be somewhat, it can be but a little dust, earth, or ashes, which the worms keep possession of.</p>
                     <p>Ladies, will you yet presume your selves fair, after you have thus now assisted in imagination and thought, to the funerals of Beauty it self after you have read, I say, the Epitaph, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon her Sepulture. I grant you have a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sweets and graces:</hi> yet now at least confess ye, that these blandishments are but of so thin aerial worths, that the wind carries them away, as if they were composed of nought else; for scarcely have they birth, but you see them decay, and then the misprise, that each one makes of them, renders them more capable to produce pity than love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But in a word,</hi> all men and women that are now buried in every <hi>Church-yard,</hi> throughout the whole world, have every one plaid their part, and it may be, that the hour will soon <hi>knell,</hi> that you must act yours.</p>
                     <p>If thou trust to thy youth, put thy head out of the window, and thou shalt presently see carried to the grave some not so old as thy self. If thou rely upon thy health which thou now enjoyest, 'tis but a false going dyal. <hi>The calm of a perfect health, hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Indeed I remember, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> in his Morals hath a like saying of some in his time, <q rend="margQuotes">There are, saith he, a number of people, who (considering, that the soul is dissolved from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the body is turned into rottenness, that rottenness returneth to dust, and that this dust is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52888:123"/> resolved into the first elements) cannot see how that by reason there should be any resurrection; and, beholding dry and dead bones, mistrust that they shall not again be clothed with their flesh, and so revive. Such men, though they cannot by faith believe as they ought, the bodies resurrection, yet let them be perswaded by this natural reason, what I pray, then doth the whole world, but imitate our resurrection daily in her elements? For, we see daily, that trees in winter want both leaves and fruit: and behold, suddenly in the spring time, out of a dry tree, as it were by a new resurrection, leaves bud out, fruits ripen, and the whole tree is apparelled with her revived beauty. Let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the dead kernel set into the earth, how a tree sprouteth out of it: and let them devise if they can where that great tree was in so small a seed? Where was the body? where the bark? where the branches? where that plenty of fruit? Do they not perceive that all these were in the kernel or seed, before it was cast into the ground? Why then should they wonder, how a little dust, resolved into elements, should, when God will, become a living body again? seeing that so small a seed, coming first out of a tree, should, by the power of God become an huge tree again. For, as the tree is in the kernel, so are our bodies <hi>in the glorified body of Christ.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And why now should it seem strange unto any that God is able to raise their body again at the last day? a Taylor can rip a Garment, and set it together again, though it be in a thousand pieces: a Clock-maker can take asunder every wheel of a watch: and joyn it together again: and shall not God be able to do the like for your body? Why, my dear <hi>fellow-traveller,</hi> did God create you of nothing, and can he not restore you from something? doth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52888:124"/> he not hold all the Elements in his hand? is not he more skilful than that <hi>Alchymist,</hi> who can extract the quintessence of any substance? is not he the <hi>Lord God of all flesh?</hi> is there any thing hard to him? <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. Can the <hi>Phenix</hi> rise out of her own ashes, and shall not you arise out of your own dust? Can the Trees revive again in the Spring, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you revive again at the last day? You see that many birds and flies are dead all winter, and revive in summer: you know that the corn, which at seed time is cast into the ground, groweth up in harvest. <hi>Shall God</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) quicken the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and dead grains of seed, whereby thou livest in this world, and shall he not much more raise thee up, that thou mayest live for ever?</hi> Know then, that as every night hath his day; every sun-setting, his sun-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; every sleeping, his awaking; every labour, his rest; and every winter, his spring time: so every Death shall have his Life. Say then, even when you are to dye, <hi>Post tenebras spero lucem: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkness I hope for light, Job</hi> 17.12. <hi>For, if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodys, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi>

                  <p>But nothing of this concerns the dead in real and effective purposes; nor is it with care to be provided for by themselves, but it is the duty of the living; for to them, it is all one whether they be carried forth in a Chariot or a wooden Bier, whether they rot in the air, or in the earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be devoured by fishes or by worms, by birds or by sepulchral dogs, by water or by fire, or by delay.</p>
                  <p>Concerning doing honour to the dead, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is not long; antiently the friends of the dead used to make their funeral Orations, and the Custom descended, and in the Channel of time it mingled it self in the veins of the earth, through which it passed. <hi>And now a days, men that die</hi> are commended <hi>at a price,</hi> and the measure of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, is the <hi>degree</hi> of their vertue. But <hi>these things ought not so to be,</hi> the reward of the greatest ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ought not to be prostitute to the doles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon persons, but preserved like flourishing Laurel and Coronets, to remark and encourage the noblest things.</p>
                  <p>But that which is most considerable is, that we perform the will of the dead, the Laws oblige us, and will see to it; but did they not, certainly it is the noblest thing in the world, to do an act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him whom we shall never see again, but yet hath deserved it of us, and to whom we would do it if he were present: and unless we do so, our charity is mercenary, and our <hi>friendships</hi> are direct merchandize, and our gifts are brokage; but what we do to the dead, or to the living for their sakes, is <hi>gratitude, and vertue for vertues sake, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest portion of humanity, kindness and love.</hi>

               <p>HE is that Damned Ghost, the first Sinner, the first Seducer; One knowing much, yet never obedient, but by constraint. He is but a Slave, as base as he is beggarly; as malicious as cursedly mischievous; blasphemously careless of God, tyrannously cruel to Men, a continual Tempter, God's Gaoler, a dreadful Tormentor: Ever is he out with God, and a hater of the Good: What God commands he condemns; he will allow what God dislikes. A bright Angel he was in Heaven, but now the black Fiend in Hell: To no Man a Friend, to the Church a most malicious Foe: He is driven out of the Penitent, he harbours in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient: The Lewd are his Lodging, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane his Habitation. He is the unclean Spirit: The place most full of Abomination is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Harbour: All his Motions are to satisfie Lust: He would have us live after our liking, to work Wickedness, to rage in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God. He knows himself to be damned; all he cares for is to make others like himself. This cursed Spirit is that <hi>Lyon</hi> roaring, strong, fearful; that <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> subtil, guilefull; that <hi>Red Dragon,</hi> bloody, terrible: He reigneth where he gets any rule, and whom he gaineth, those willingly he will not let gò. Antichrist is his eldest Son, the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Crue his cursed Children. He is the Inventer of all Villany, the Author of Heresie, the Setter up of Idolatry, the Plotter of Conspiracy. He rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Rebellion, and works Treason. He turns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into Superstition, Love into Lechery, Friends
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52888:142"/> into Foes, Consent into Contention, Peace into bloody Persecution: He comes where the Godly be, and good Exercises; not for love to them, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously, as an Instrument to hinder them. He will send <hi>Cain</hi> to sacrifice with <hi>Abel,</hi> but afterwards to murther him; he will thrust <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but to betray Christ. He is equally envious as malicious: If Christ plants a Church, he will erect a Chappel. If he have Apostles, this will raise up false Teachers: If Christ sowe Wheat, he will scatter Tares. He deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> which brought a Curse to the Earth: He provoked <hi>David</hi> to fall to numbering, that the People might be plagued. He is that grand Liar, that shameless Slanderer; he is as impudent as irrepentant. He tempted Christ himself importunately; he vexeth his Members, and that daily: He is full of fair words: He makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promises, but doth never perform what is good. He is a Machiavilian; when he pretendeth most to do well, then he intendeth most mischief, and to do ill. He keeps men in Ignorance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades them of Faith, he puts them in hope of Salvation; and yet disswades from the Grace of Sanctification. He would have the wickedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to presume of Mercy, and the Godly Penitent to despair in apprehension of Justice. He induceth his to believe, that good meaning, without the Word, is warrant enough in Gods Worship, and blind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to be a great growth in Religion. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Wickedness with Titles of Goodness. He puts a fair Vizour over the ugly face of Sin: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Pride must be cleanly Decency, no Pomp; filthy Lust, but a trick of Youth, no Carnality; bad Company with Pot-mates, good fellowship, no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Covetousness in the Niggard, thrifty Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, no sordid Quality; Prodigal Expences, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness, no Unthriftiness; Intemperateness in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52888:142"/> Meetings, neighbourly Merriments, no Gluttony, nor Drunkenness; Riot, Recreation; idle Musing, Contemplation. Thus he blindeth him that cares not to see Sin, that so a Man may be secure in hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Hell. He that is most in Transgression, is his best Son, yet is the greatest Sinner his basest Slave; Whoso doth most for him, shall in the end be most tormented by him. God commands his Children for their own Salvation; but Satan his Servants to bring them to Confusion. All his are either carnal Atheists, gross Idolaters, hypocritical Time-servers, foolishly Superstitious, damnably Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, proud Hereticks, or idle-headed Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. He will allow some of his to be of the visible Church, yet only a <hi>Cain,</hi> an <hi>Achitophel,</hi> a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> without invisible Grace: He will give them leave to profess, but not to practise: He lets them know Verity, but not acknowledge it with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; their Service is only fashion: Hypocrites are his Saints, Custome his Canon, Sophistry his Reason: His Kingdom is Darkness, Schismaticks his zealous Servants, Hereticks his chief Champions; his Company the accursed, the Profane his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Attendants, next to the Fiends, the hellish Inhabitants; the Reward to his, Wrath from God, Seclusion from the Good: The place for their abode is the infernal Pit, there to be tortured in torment, and plagued with eternal Pains without end.</p>

               </head>
               <p>COncerning a late or <hi>Death-bed-Repentance,</hi> it must first be acknowledged, that one of those two things is ordinarily understood by it, either the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting our accounts with God</hi> at that time, <hi>reinforcing all our former good resolutions, and shutting up</hi> that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of our Souls, which in time of health had been sincerely <hi>begun,</hi> but not <hi>perfected;</hi> or else the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of that work of <hi>Repentance</hi> at that time.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Gentle Readers,</hi> the Design of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise is to intreat you, to beware of that infinite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard that attends a <hi>Death-bed-Repentance;</hi> Oh venture
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52888:143"/> not Eternity upon your last Breath! Make <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> your early, your continual Business, your Duty, your Obligation; which will administer a delightful Reflection on your following years, prove the truest Frugality and Improvement of Time, the greatest ease, and quiet, comfort and safety both of Life and Death. Those that now load themselves with <hi>guilt</hi> under the delusion of <hi>Pleasure, that</hi> gives them secret disquiet while they are laying it on, treasure up shame and sorrow for the time to come, horror and despair for a dying hour. All men seek <hi>the Lord</hi> some time or other; only wise men <hi>betimes,</hi> while he may be found. <hi>Old Age</hi> is the Lot but of a very few, grievous and burthensome enough of it self; but disconsolate and opprest indeed, when Men come to possess the Diseases, and Infirmities of it, together with the Iniquities of their youth; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if not fruitless Repentance for their mispending it. Yet <hi>Death</hi> observes not the course of the Law of Nature, but the Determination of God. <hi>Boast not thy self of to morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</hi> Possibly <hi>this day</hi> may bring forth thy <hi>Death,</hi> how then shall <hi>to morrow</hi> bring forth thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> or make thee another Tender of this dayes rejected Salvation. Every day puts a Period to many lives, as well secured as ours, and who have had the same Reason of Hope with our selves. No man ever miscarried because his life was <hi>short,</hi> but <hi>bad:</hi> 'twas no loss to <hi>Gideon,</hi> that he returned from Victory before the Sun was up. There's no danger of being wise and good too soon; but all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be learnt in <hi>another World,</hi> comes too late to remedy any final miscarriage in <hi>this.</hi> We may be instantly surprized by <hi>Death,</hi> or a <hi>Disease</hi> that inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates us to call for Mercy in general; much more to make our selves meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in life.</p>

               <p>The face of <hi>Death</hi> will have a sad Appearance to those that have loytered, unthriftily trifled away their Time, that never knew the worth of it until their last hour, and they have their work to do. <hi>Eternity at Hand,</hi> gives value to all Holiness and Sense of God in spite of the world, and lessens all things else into less than nothing, and Vanity; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints a ghastliness and horror upon wickedness and sensuality. The <hi>Thirty pieces</hi> are nothing worth, and the <hi>Innocent Blood</hi> above all value, when Men suffer in the Agonies of Conscience, and fears of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Judge. <hi>An House-ful of Silver and Gold</hi> will not buy a Man to resist God, when the Terrible Majesty appears to him: nothing is so precious then, that a man will not fling to the Bats and Moles. When the Breath is going out of the Nostrils, how precious is sincere Holiness to those that have slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as a thing of nought. As if the great Truths of Gods Word were never true till a day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we die. But <hi>these things</hi> are alwayes so rich and valuable. <hi>True Wisdom</hi> is alwayes so precious, that it disdains to borrow Esteem from a Minute of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. And therefore, it mostly falls out, that those who would have none of its Counsel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised all its Reproofs, when they come to seek it now, cannot find it, but it laughs at their Calamity, and their Misery confutes their Confidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A good Death</hi> is the natural consequence of a <hi>Holy life;</hi> else, there's no such thing in <hi>Nature,</hi> nor <hi>Grace</hi> neither, except by a <hi>Miracle</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> The most profligate and obdurate, cannot but think that they must repent, and acknowledge the Prudence and safety of the Religious, whom they contemned. They own their own folly and mistake, when it's too late to remedy: They desire to <hi>die</hi> the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and promise to live <hi>their life</hi> too, if they recover from s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52888:144"/> looked upon necessary to be lived, it cannot be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meerly to resolve it. <hi>Religion</hi> never gave any man a Dispensation to Sin, that's one thing. We have entered into a Covenant with God to forsake the Devil and all his works. The Conditions of our Salvation, are our giving up our selves, Bodies and Souls, not a dying, but a living Sacrifice unto God. To deny ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world. The wicked must not only forsake his ways, and the untighteous man his thoughts; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from all his wickedness that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unto the Lord; but keep all his Statutes, and do that which is right, acquire and exercise the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of every Grace, as well as mortifie and overcome all corrupt Affections, and vitious Inclinations. Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of good works. He bare our Sins in his own Body upon the Tree, that we being dead to Sin, should live unto Righteousness. And is it Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>this</hi> should be wholly frustrate by those sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be Redeemed by Him we dishonour, and endeavour to make void the purpose and design of his Sufferings, and Redemption, if we think them to be a shelter for our ungodly Living. <hi>The Gospel</hi> (the highest display of Mercy) is not a Salvation of men, in, but from Sin; and by <hi>Repentance</hi> means a Reformed course of life; and only by very silent Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations (the Tract of which is hardly discerned) leaves it possible that he should pluck some as brands out of the fire, by giving them Repentance at last: whereas, this is now become the only Repentance in use, the universal Refuge. But, the goodly price of a Death-bed-Repentance, at which God is prized by most, even then when Religion is at the lowest, is rejected with Indignation, and the Everlasting

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52888:149"/> to possess all places, while those Silver-footed Nymphs, that by so many windings arrive at the watry Arms of <hi>Neptune,</hi> send forth their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent murmurs louder, not drowned with greater noise: If the Sun hath set in a Cloud, it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged Storms to the ensuing day.</p>
               <p>I find a resemblance in my lesser World, of Nights Livery, when I wink the World into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by which all Beauties lose their distinctions; all lye lovingly together in the bosom of Sleep, and agree in their obedience to these soft Injunctions, and delightful Commands of Nature. Here the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser is pleasantly rob'd of his Store, and the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of his sense of being poor. The ambitious man leaves to court greatness, and is content with the ordinary favours of <hi>Morpheus:</hi> The Lover layes aside the <hi>sweet tortures</hi> of his Amours, and solaces himself only in the <hi>dusky Embraces</hi> of Sleep: The Soldier, in making his passage to the Gates of <hi>vocal Fame,</hi> ceases to invite <hi>Death,</hi> and is here content with its <hi>Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now do our Senses, which are the Birds that make the musick in mans little Grove, shrowd themselves under the downy Wings of Sleep. Thus doth Death equalize all things only for a longer time; in its Habitations a quiet horror seems to dwell, where all lye lovingly in the bosom of their Mother Earth, silently crept under the soft Coverings of Ashes; where our divided parts revel in their loosened Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had before been crowded together in our sickly Composures. I lye merrily down in my Bed, though I expect to rise again, to resume the burthen of all my fears, hopes, and griefs, the constant <hi>Attendants of my life;</hi> and yet look sadly and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon the <hi>Grave,</hi> my Corruption belonging to the maintaining of the Order of the <hi>Ʋniverse;</hi> where at my next <hi>rising,</hi> much gayer clad than before, I shall awake to <hi>Immortality</hi> and <hi>endless Joy.</hi> With

                  </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; how little they contribute towards it, to me alone, till I be mixt with those people, and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in those Opinions.</p>
               <p>We entertain with true and real passions the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical compositions of the Stage; there being in mans life Plays, not acted, but lived; solemn fictions, not feigned, but believed. Men now acknowledge their own Natures, whom Precept had taught to regulate themselves all day, and familiarly own the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons Nature hath charactered on them.</p>
               <p>Now doth the ever-running streams of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which run over our hard and stony hearts, speak louder to us, not drowned with the noyse of worldly thoughts. If the Sun hath gone down in the clouds of our envy and malice, it presages fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture storms of passions to our life.</p>
               <p>And now, Lord, I will seek him in my Bed, whom my Soul loves: Let me find thee, in the rest thou givest my Soul from Sin and Vanity, in the sleep thou givest my affections, they being all quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe Poets sometimes gratifie the largeness of mans Soul with their lofty flights, writing to immortality; and in the excess of their fancy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with Deities, tumbling among the Stars with <hi>Jove:</hi> and anon, let the motions of their Spirits down again, to view the contents of moderate and private Fortunes. Thus we see sometime the Scean of the greatest mens lives altered; now representing you the prospect of Armies, Triumphs of Victories, Grandeur of State, the glory of Courts, Camps, and Cities; anon, in their rooms, succeeding Groves and pleasant Rivers, private Walks, Discourses of the Worlds Vanities, Experiments of Nature, and such Companions of solitariness: When all the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Pride and vain Opinions are faln, and Nature freed from those affectations it hath got abroad, it acknowledgeth it self, its own Bents and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A Life led according to Nature, is the real enjoying of things themselves; but if according to Art and Opinion, it's like as in Pictures; they view things drawn well to the Life, representations of Love, Honour, and Vertue; yet nothing but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that lose their glories by mens nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. The joyes of an active life are more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52888:155"/> to Nature, moving in the Sphere of Vertue, than any recessions from Society can afford, whose priviledge can only be, to think Vertue. The Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine power of the mind is not beholding to places for their satisfactions; but what is the true and real dignity of one place before another, by an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Chymistrie he can extract, and translate to his own mind their preheminencies. There can in no place be wanting Groves, Rivers, singing of Birds; our bodies are a shadie Grove, where our Souls s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These thoughts are, as it were, the better <hi>Genius,</hi> which attends the Lakes: without which, their retirements are but the refuges of mens sickly humours; where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to live of their malady, rather than to cure it; and do only sacrifice the fumes of melancholy, for that incense of service, which they owe as a tribute for their being.</p>
               <p>Those that would make loneness acceptable, by advising men, as through a Prospective, to behold the greatness of Structures, and bravery of Courts, through the humility of the Cottage, do make ones deluded fancy the ground of their content, imagining that he still enjoys those things, which commonly so swells mens minds, that they cannot with that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of judgment taste those purer pleasures, which arise from the observation of Nature, making as it were his Disease his Cure; the immoderate esteem of the other having so vitiated his pallat, that he can relish nothing else, though it be by the proxy of the fancy.</p>

The <hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi> being met at a place and time appointed, the <hi>Devil</hi> there appears in human shape, admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be faithful, and promising them success and length of Life; then those that are present, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Person who is to be entred; the <hi>Devil</hi> then requires him to renounce the Christian Faith, and Sacraments, and giving him his hand, tells him, that this alone is not sufficient, but that he must worship him likewise, and give himself to him Body and Soul for ever, and bring as many as possibly he can into the same Society; and that he must prepare himself certain Ointments, and then be confirmed therein. <hi>Manlius</hi> writes, that in the Year 1553, Two <hi>Witches</hi> stole a Neighbours Child, and murdering

The hour wherein she had promised the Phary Prince some fruits of her Needle, hapned to be one day as she was at dinner with many Noble Persons, having quite forgot her promise, when on a suddain casting her eye to the door, she saw an infinite train of Pharies come in: so that fixing her eyes on them, and remembring how she neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected her promise, she sate as one amazed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished the whole company. But at last the train had mounted upon the Table, and as they were prancing on their Horses round the brims of a large dish of white-broth, an Officer that seemed too busie in making way before them, fell into the dish, which caused the Lady to burst into a suddain fit of laughter, and thereby to recover her senses. when the whole Phary company was come upon the Table, that the brims of every dish seemed fill'd with little Horse men, she saw the Prince coming towards her, and hearing she had not done what she promised, seemed to go away displeased. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy presently fell into a fit of Melancholly, and being asked by her friends the cause of these alterations and astonishments, related the whole matter; but notwithstanding all their consolations, pined away, and dyed not long after.</p>
